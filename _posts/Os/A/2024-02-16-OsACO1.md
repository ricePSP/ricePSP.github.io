* **Key message**  
    + OsEBP89, an ethylene responsive element binding protein (EREBP) and OsACO1, an ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) oxidase gene were enhanced in the OsEIL1 overexpressing transgenic plants
    + In this study, we found that expression of the rice Aconitase gene OsACO1 is induced in a time-dependent manner by heat but not other typical abiotic stresses
