* **Key message**  
    + OsBLE2 expressed more, as revealed by in situ hybridization, in vascular bundles and root primordia, where the cells are actively undergoing division, elongation, and differentiation
    + OsBLE2 expression was most responsive to BL in the lamina joint and leaf sheath in rice seedlings
    + Transgenic rice expressing antisense OsBLE2 exhibits various degrees of repressed growth
    + These results suggest that OsBLE2 is involved in BL-regulated growth and development processes in rice
    + BL could not enhance its expression in transgenic rice expressing antisense BRI1, a BR receptor, indicating that BR signaling to the enhanced expression of OsBLE2 is through BRI1
