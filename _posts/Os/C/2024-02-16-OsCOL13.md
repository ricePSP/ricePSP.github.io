* **Publication**  
    + [A CONSTANS-like transcriptional activator, OsCOL13, functions as a negative regulator of flowering downstream of OsphyB and upstream of Ehd1 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A CONSTANS-like transcriptional activator, OsCOL13, functions as a negative regulator of flowering downstream of OsphyB and upstream of Ehd1 in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2016, Plant Mol Biol.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + We also demonstrated that OsCOL13 has a constitutive and rhythmic expression pattern, and that OsCOL13 is localized to the nucleus
