* **Key message**  
    + Expression of rice anther specific monosaccharide transporter (OsMST8) is greatly affected by chilling treatment
    + Perturbed carbohydrate metabolism, which is particularly triggered by repressed genes OsINV4 and OsMST8 during chilling, causes unusual starch storage in the endothecium and this also contributes to other symptoms such as vacuolation and poor microspore wall formation

    + __OSINV4__, __OsMST8__, [Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Effects of chilling on male gametophyte development in rice%5BTitle%5D), Perturbed carbohydrate metabolism, which is particularly triggered by repressed genes OsINV4 and OsMST8 during chilling, causes unusual starch storage in the endothecium and this also contributes to other symptoms such as vacuolation and poor microspore wall formation
