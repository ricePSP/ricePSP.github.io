* **Key message**  
    + WTG1 determines grain size and shape mainly by influencing cell expansion
    + Overexpression of WTG1 results in narrow, thin and long grains due to narrow and long cells, further supporting the role of WTG1 in determining grain size and shape
    + Thus, our findings identify the otubain-like protease WTG1 as an important factor that determines grain size and shape, suggesting WTG1 has the potential to improve grain size and shape in rice
    + WTG1 is expressed in developing grains and panicles, and the GFP-WTG1 fusion protein is present in the nucleus and the cytoplasm
    + OsOTUB1 interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating protein OsUBC13 and the squamosa promoter-binding protein-like transcription factor OsSPL14
    + Downregulation of OsOTUB1 enhances meristematic activity, resulting in reduced tiller number, increased grain number, enhanced grain weight and a consequent increase in grain yield in rice
    + Conversely, loss-of-function of OsOTUB1 is correlated with the accumulation of high levels of OsSPL14, resulting in the NPT architecture
