* **Key message**  
    + These results suggest that OsCPK21 is involved in the positive regulation of the signaling pathways that are involved in the response to ABA and salt stress
    + Functional characterisation of OsCPK21, a calcium-dependent protein kinase that confers salt tolerance in rice
    + The survival rate of the OsCPK21-FOX plants was higher than that of wild-type (WT) plants grown under high salinity conditions
    + Several ABA- and high salinity-inducible genes were more highly expressed in the OsCPK21-FOX plants than in WT plants
    + The inhibition of seedling growth by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment was greater in the OsCPK21-FOX plants than in WT plants
    + These results suggest that OsCPK21 phosphorylates OsGF14e to facilitate the response to ABA and salt stress
    + We used an in<U+00A0>vitro kinase assay and site-directed mutagenesis to verify that OsCPK21 phosphorylates OsGF14e at Tyr-138
