* **Key message**  
    + Knockout of OsYSL6 resulted in decreased growth of both roots and shoots only in the high-manganese (Mn) condition
    + OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice
    + Taken together, our results suggest that OsYSL6 is a Mn-nicotianamine transporter that is required for the detoxification of excess Mn in rice
    + OsYSL6 was constitutively expressed in both the shoots and roots, and the expression level was not affected by either deficiency or toxicity of various metals
    + Analysis with OsYSL6 promoter-green fluorescent protein transgenic rice revealed that OsYSL6 was expressed in all cells of both the roots and shoots
