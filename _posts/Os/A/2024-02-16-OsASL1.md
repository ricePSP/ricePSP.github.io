* **Key message**  
    + Here, we further characterized OsASL1 in terms of expression pattern, subcellular localization, and arginine effect on the root growth
    + Our results indicate that the subcellular localization was determined by the N terminus of OsASL1 and that appropriate concentration of Arg is required for normal root elongation in rice
    + 1 was expressed in most organs throughout the whole growth period, whereas OsASL1
    + Our results indicate that the subcellular localization was determined by the N terminus of OsASL1 and that appropriate concentration of Arg is required for normal root elongation in rice.
