    + __SH5__, __SHAT1__, [The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D), We also determined that two shattering-related genes, SHAT1 and Sh4, which are necessary for proper formation of an AZ, were induced by SH5.
    + __sh4~SHA1__, __SH5__, [The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D), We also determined that two shattering-related genes, SHAT1 and Sh4, which are necessary for proper formation of an AZ, were induced by SH5.

    + __D6~OSH15~Oskn3__, __SH5__, [KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes.%5BTitle%5D),  Analyses of osh15 SH5-D double mutants showed that SH5 could not increase the degree of seed shattering when OSH15 was absent, indicating that SH5 functions together with OSH15
    + __D6~OSH15~Oskn3__, __SH5__, [KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes.%5BTitle%5D),  Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that both OSH15 and SH5 directly interact with CAD2 chromatin
    + __D6~OSH15~Oskn3__, __SH5__, [KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes.%5BTitle%5D),  We conclude that OSH15 and SH5 form a dimer that enhances seed shattering by directly inhibiting lignin biosynthesis genes
