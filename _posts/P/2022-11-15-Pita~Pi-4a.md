* **Key message**  
    + Rice blast disease resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea is triggered by a physical interaction between the protein products of the host R (resistance) gene, Pi-ta, and the pathogen Avr (avirulence) gene, AVR-pita
    + Resistance to the blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae is proposed to be initiated by physical binding of a putative cytoplasmic receptor encoded by a nucleotide binding site-type resistance gene, Pi-ta, to the processed elicitor encoded by the corresponding avirulence gene AVR-Pita
    + Rice expressing the Pi-ta gene is resistant to strains of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea, expressing AVR-Pita in a gene-for-gene relationship
    + The rice blast resistance (R) gene Pi-ta mediates gene-for-gene resistance against strains of the fungus Magnaporthe grisea that express avirulent alleles of AVR-Pita
    + Three major genes (Pi1, Piz-5 and Pita) for blast resistance on chromosomes 11, 6 and 12, respectively, were fine-mapped and closely linked RFLP markers identified
    + The Pi-ta gene in rice prevents the infections by races of Magnaporthe oryzae containing AVR-Pita
    + Molecular cloning of the AVR-Pita and Pi-ta genes will aid in deployment of R genes for effective genetic control of rice blast disease
    + In the present study, 1790 accessions were characterized for Pi-ta, and Pi-ta independent resistance genes using marker analysis, disease evaluation with the race IB-49 carrying AVR-Pita, and IE-1k not carrying AVR-Pita and sequence analysis
    + These data suggest that the AVR-Pita(176) protein binds directly to the Pi-ta LRD region inside the plant cell to initiate a Pi-ta-mediated defense response
