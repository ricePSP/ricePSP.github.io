* **Key message**  
    + The results indicate that OsSARD1 plays an important role in the regulation of the defense responses to GR and IB irradiation and exhibits phytohormone induced expression
    + In addition, OsSARD1 protein was abundantly accumulated in the nucleus
    + The OsSARD1 gene was induced after exposure to SA and JA
