* **Key message**  
    + Conversely, OsCDPK11 protein levels were high at the beginning of seed development, but fell rapidly from 10 DAF onwards
    + Rice calcium-dependent protein kinase isoforms OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 show different responses to light and different expression patterns during seed development
    + OsCDPK13 accumulated in 2-week-old leaf sheath and callus, and became phosphorylated in response to cold and gibberellin (GA)
    + OsCDPK13, a calcium-dependent protein kinase gene from rice, is induced by cold and gibberellin in rice leaf sheath
    + OsCDPK13, a calcium-dependent protein kinase gene from rice, is induced in response to cold and gibberellin
    + Furthermore, OsCDPK13 gene expression and protein accumulation were enhanced in response to cold, but suppressed under salt and drought stresses
    + OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 cDNAs are related to SPK, another gene encoding a rice CDPK that is specifically expressed in developing seeds [20]
    + Recently, a full-length cDNA encoding OsCDPK13 from rice seedling was isolated
    + The results suggest that OsCDPK13 might be an important signaling component in the response of rice to GA and cold stress
    + Antisense OsCDPK13 transgenic rice lines were shorter than the vector control lines, and the expression of OsCDPK13 was lower in dwarf mutants of rice than in wild type
    + OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 mRNAs are equally abundant in rice roots and coleoptiles
    + OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 mRNA and protein levels increased in unison during flower development
    + Sense OsCDPK13 transgenic rice lines had higher recovery rates after cold stress than vector control rice
