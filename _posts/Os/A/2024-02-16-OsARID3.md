* **Key message**  
    + Disruption of OsARID3 leads to defective SAM, early seedling lethality, and impaired capacity of in vitro shoot regeneration
    + We conclude that OsARID3 is an AT-rich specific DNA-binding protein and that it plays a major role in SAM development in rice
    + We show that the expression levels of several KNOXI genes and the biosynthetic genes for auxin and cytokinin are significantly altered in the Osarid3 mutant calli
    + Moreover, we determine that auxin concentrations are increased whereas cytokinin levels are decreased in Osarid3 calli
    + Furthermore, our chromatin immunoprecipitation results demonstrate that OsARID3 binds directly to the KNOXI gene OSH71, the auxin biosynthetic genes OsYUC1 and OsYUC6, and the cytokinin biosynthetic genes OsIPT2 and OsIPT7
