* **Key message**  
    + High levels of ONAC300 mRNA were detected by in situ hybridization in developing shoot apical meristem (SAM) and in the associated young leaves
    + RT-PCR analysis further revealed that the levels of ONAC300 transcripts were higher in leaves, roots and culms than in panicles
    + Thus, ONAC300 is a novel member of the NAC family which is expressed at very early developmental stages in the shoot, root and flower, as well as in the mature phloem of vascular tissues in rice
    + The use of an ONAC300:: GUS reporter gene revealed that the ONAC300 promoter was expressed predominantly in developing vascular tissues of the leaves and roots
