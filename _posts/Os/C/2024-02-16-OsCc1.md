* **Key message**  
    + Large amounts of OsCc1 transcripts are found in the roots, calli, and suspension cells, but relatively lower in mature leaves, demonstrating its higher levels of expression in non-photosynthetic tissues
    + OsCc1 promoter directs expression in virtually all organs of transgenic plants including roots, leaves, calli, embryos, and suspension cells, showing a particularly high activity in calli and roots
    + Activity of the OsCc1 promoter was 3-fold higher than Act1 in calli and roots and comparable with RbcS in leaves, representing a useful alternative to the maize (Zea mays) Ubi1 and the rice Act1 promoters for transgene expression in monocots
