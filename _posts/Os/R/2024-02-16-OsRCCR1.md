    + [Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice%5BTitle%5D), 2011, J Plant Physiol.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Expression analysis by semi-quantitative PCR or quantitative real-time PCR showed that OsRCCR1 transcripts were much more abundant than OsRCCR2, and all of these genes were upregulated during senescence and following wound treatment
    + These results suggest that OsPAO and OsRCCR1 play key roles in senescence and are involved in wound responses
