* **Key message**  
    + Genetic evidence is presented to strengthen the observation that the primary action of RAVL1 mediates the expression of genes involved in BR signaling and biosynthesis
    + Also, RAVL1 is necessary for the response of these genes to changes in cellular BR homeostasis
    + This study thus describes a regulatory circuit modulating the homeostasis of BR in which RAVL1 ensures the basal activity of both the signaling and the biosynthetic pathways
    + This report shows that RAVL1 regulates the expression of the BR receptor
    + Furthermore, RAVL1 is also required for the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes D2, D11, and BRD1 that are subject to BR negative feedback
    + Moreover, (15)NH4(+) uptake, cellular ammonium contents, and root responses to methyl-ammonium strongly depended on RAVL1 levels
