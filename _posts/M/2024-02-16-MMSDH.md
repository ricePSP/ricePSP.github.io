* **Key message**  
    + MMSDH responded to auxin and gibberellin, but did not respond to brassinolide and cytokinin
    + Furthermore, the amount of MMSDH in slr1, a constitutive gibberellin response mutant, was 2-fold that of wild type
    + MMSDH was detected in cultured suspension cells, root and leaf sheath, but not in leaf blades
    + Of these seven, methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH) was elevated by treatment with auxin alone
    + MMSDH mRNA and protein were stimulated in root formation induced by auxin and/or zinc over a 4-week period
    + These results suggest that MMSDH may be necessary for root formation in rice induced by auxin and/or zinc
