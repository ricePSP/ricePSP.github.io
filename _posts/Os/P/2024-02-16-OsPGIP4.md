* **Key message**  
    + OsPGIP4 overexpression enhances resistance to bacterial leaf streak in rice
    + Here, we show that the chromosomal location of OsPGIP4 coincides with the major bacterial leaf streak resistance quantitative trait locus qBlsr5a on the short arm of chromosome 5
    + Our results not only provide the first report that rice PGIP could enhance resistant against a bacterial pathogen but also indicate that OsPGIP4 is a potential component of the qBlsr5a locus for bacterial leaf streak in rice
    + OsPGIP4 overexpression enhanced the resistance of the susceptible rice variety Zhonghua 11 to RS105
    + In contrast, repressing OsPGIP4 expression resulted in an increase in disease lesions caused by RS105 in Zhonghua 11 and in Acc8558, a qBlsr5a resistance donor
    + OsPGIP4 expression was up-regulated upon inoculation with the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv
