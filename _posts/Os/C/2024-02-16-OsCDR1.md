* **Key message**  
    + The Oryza sativa constitutive disease resistance 1 (OsCDR1) gene product is an aspartic proteinase that has been implicated in disease resistance signaling
    + Heterologous expression and characterization of recombinant OsCDR1, a rice aspartic proteinase involved in disease resistance
    + Expression of OsCDR1 was activated upon treatments with benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid, which are signal molecules in plant disease resistance responses
    + Overexpression of rice (Oryza sativa L.) OsCDR1 leads to constitutive activation of defense responses in rice and Arabidopsis
    + Infiltration of the OsCDR1 fusion protein into leaves of Arabidopsis plants induced PR2 transcripts in both the infiltrated leaf (primary) and in non-treated secondary leaves while the inactive recombinant protein failed to induce either local or systemic PR2
    + These findings demonstrate that OsCDR1 is capable of inducing systemic defense responses in plants
