    + [A zinc finger protein, interacted with cyclophilin, affects root development via IAA pathway in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A zinc finger protein, interacted with cyclophilin, affects root development via IAA pathway in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2017, J Integr Plant Biol.

* **Key message**  
    + T2 OsZFP-RNAi lines had significantly fewer lateral roots than did wild type plants, which suggests a role for OsCYP2 and OsZFP in regulating lateral root development
    + These findings imply that OsCYP2 and OsZFP participate in IAA signal pathways controlling lateral root development
