    + __EBL1__, __OsACO1__, [Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice%5BTitle%5D), Since the OsEREBP1-like gene EBL1 (OsEREBP1-LIKE 1) was significantly downregulated in phyAphyBphyC mutants, EBL1 was suspected to repress ACO1 expression in wild-type plants
    + __EBL1__, __OsACO1__, [Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Phytochrome-regulated EBL1 contributes to ACO1 upregulation in rice%5BTitle%5D), However, ACO1 was downregulated in EBL1 RNA interference plants, and the total length of these plants was slightly shorter than that of wild-type plants
