* **Key message**  
    + GLO1 and GLO4 are predominately expressed in rice leaves, while GLO3 and GLO5 are mainly expressed in the root

    + __GLO1__, __GLO4__, [Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice%5BTitle%5D), GLO1 and GLO4 are predominately expressed in rice leaves, while GLO3 and GLO5 are mainly expressed in the root
    + __GLO1__, __GLO4__, [Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice%5BTitle%5D), Further analyses suggested that GLO1, GLO3 and GLO4 interacted with each other, but no interactions were observed for GLO5
    + __GLO1__, __GLO4__, [Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice%5BTitle%5D), GLO1/GLO4 co-expressed in yeast exhibited the same isozyme pattern as that from rice leaves
    + __GLO1__, __GLO4__, [Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice%5BTitle%5D), When either GLO1 or GLO4 was silenced, expressions of both genes were simultaneously suppressed and most of the GLO activities were lost, and consistent with this observation, little GLO isozyme protein was detected in the silenced plants
    + __GLO1__, __GLO4__, [Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice%5BTitle%5D), Comparative analyses between the GLO isoforms expressed in yeast and the isozymes from rice leaves indicated that two of the five isozymes are homo-oligomers composed of either GLO1 or GLO4, and the other three are hetero-oligomers composed of both GLO1 and GLO4
    + __GLO1__, __GLO4__, [Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice%5BTitle%5D), Our current data suggest that GLO isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice, and the existence of GLO isozymes and GLO molecular and compositional complexities implicate potential novel roles for GLO in plants
