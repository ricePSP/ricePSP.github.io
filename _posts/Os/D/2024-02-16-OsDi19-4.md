* **Key message**  
    + Identification of rice Di19 family reveals OsDi19-4 involved in drought resistance.
    + Overexpression of OsDi19-4 in rice increased drought tolerance by enhancing ROS-scavenging activity
    + In this study, we found that overexpressing OsDi19-4 in rice altered the expression of a series of ABA-responsive genes, resulting in strong ABA hypersensitive phenotypes including ABA-induced seed germination inhibition, early seedling growth inhibition and stomatal closure
    + OsDi19-4 acts downstream of OsCDPK14 to positively regulate ABA response in rice.
    + Taken together, these data demonstrate that OsDi19-4 acts downstream of OsCDPK14 to positively regulate ABA response by modulating the expression of ABA-responsive genes in rice
    + On the contrary, OsDi19-4 knock-down lines were less sensitive to ABA
    + Additionally, OsCDPK14 was identified to interact with OsDi19-4 and be responsible for the phosphorylation of OsDi19-4, and the phosphorylation of OsDi19-4 was further enhanced after the treatment of ABA
    + Transient expression assays confirmed the direct regulation role of OsDi19-4, and the regulation was further enhanced by the increased phosphorylation of OsDi19-4 after the treatment of ABA
