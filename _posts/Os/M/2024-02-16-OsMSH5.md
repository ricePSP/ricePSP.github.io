* **Key message**  
    + The synaptonemal complex is well installed in Osmsh5, while the chiasma frequency is greatly reduced to approximately 10% of that observed in the wild-type, leading to the homologous non-disjunction and complete sterile phenotype
    + Immunofluorescence studies indicate that OsMSH5 chromosomal localization is limited to the early meiotic prophase I
    + OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10
    + Here, we report the identification and characterization of its rice homolog, OsMSH5, and demonstrate its function in rice meiosis
    + The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis
    + OsMSH5 is predominantly expressed in panicles
    + Five independent Osmsh5 mutants exhibited normal vegetative growth and severe sterility
    + The MSH4-MSH5 heterodimer has been demonstrated in mammals to stabilize the formation of progenitor and double Holliday junctions that may be resolved as crossovers (COs).
