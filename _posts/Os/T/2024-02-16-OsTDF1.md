* **Key message**  
    + The functional analysis of OsTDF1 reveals a conserved genetic pathway for tapetal development between rice and Arabidopsis
    + The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that OsTDF1 acts downstream of UDT1 and upstream of TDR, EAT1, OsMYB103 and PTC1 in rice, suggesting that the genetic pathway for tapetum development is generally conserved between rice and Arabidopsis
    + Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assays revealed OsTDF1 acts as an essential regulator for tapetum programmed cell death
    + RT-PCR and in situ hybridization show that OsTDF1 is specifically expressed in tapetal cells of rice anthers
