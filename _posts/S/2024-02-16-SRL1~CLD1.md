* **Key message**  
    + Here we report the isolation and characterization of SEMI-ROLLED LEAF1 (SRL1), a gene involved in the regulation of leaf rolling
    + These results provide the transcript profile of rice leaf cells that will become bulliform cells and demonstrate that SRL1 regulates leaf rolling through inhibiting the formation of bulliform cells by negatively regulating the expression of genes encoding vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunits and H(+)-pyrophosphatase, which will help to understand the mechanism regulating leaf rolling
    + The defects in leaf epidermis decrease the water-retaining capacity and lead to water deficits in cld1 leaves, which contribute to the main cause of leaf rolling
    + Map-based cloning revealed that CLD1 is allelic with SRL1 and loss its function in cld1 through DNA methylation
    + Due to the more rapid water loss and lower water content in leaves, cld1 exhibits reduced drought tolerance
    + The cld1 mutant exhibits significant decreases in cellulose and lignin contents in secondary cell walls of leaves, indicating that loss-of-function of CLD1/SRL1 affects cell wall formation
