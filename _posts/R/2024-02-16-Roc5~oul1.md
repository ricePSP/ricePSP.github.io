* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Interestingly, overexpression of Roc5 led to adaxially rolled leaves, whereas cosuppression of Roc5 resulted in abaxial leaf rolling
    + Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice
    + To understand the molecular mechanism controlling leaf rolling, we screened a rice T-DNA insertion population and isolated the outcurved leaf1 (oul1) mutant showing abaxial leaf rolling

    + __PFL__, __Roc5~oul1__, [Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice%5BTitle%5D), Gene expression profiling, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and RNA interference (RNAi) analyses revealed that Protodermal Factor Like (PFL) was probably down-regulated in oul1
