* **Key message**  
    + Our data showed that rice LRK1 is a plasma membrane protein expressed constitutively in leaves, young panicles, roots and culms
    + The over-expression of rice LRK1 results in increased panicles, spikelets per panicle, weight per grain and enhanced cellular proliferation, leading to a 27
    + The functional characterization of rice LRK1 facilitates an understanding of the mechanisms involved in cereal crop yield, and may have utility in improving grain yield in cereal crops
    + Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components
    + Analyses of gene expression demonstrated that LRK1 restricts gibberellin biosynthesis during the internode elongation process by down-regulation of the gibberellin biosynthetic gene coding for ent-kaurene oxidase
    + Our data suggest that rice LRK1 regulates rice branch number by enhancing cellular proliferation
