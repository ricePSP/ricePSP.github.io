    + [PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene%5BTitle%5D), 1997, Plant Cell.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Our results suggest that PCF1 and PCF2 are involved in meristematic tissue-specific expression of the rice PCNA gene through binding to sites IIa and IIb and formation of homodimers or heterodimers

    + __PCF1__, __PCF2~OsPCF2__, [PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene%5BTitle%5D), The motif is > 70% homologous to several expressed sequence tags from Arabidopsis and rice, suggesting that PCF1 and PCF2 are members of a novel family of proteins that are conserved in monocotyledons and dicotyledons
    + __PCF1__, __PCF2~OsPCF2__, [PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=PCF1 and PCF2 specifically bind to cis elements in the rice proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene%5BTitle%5D), PCF1 and PCF2 were also more likely to form heterodimers than homodimers
