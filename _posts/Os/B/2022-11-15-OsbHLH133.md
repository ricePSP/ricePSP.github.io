* **Key message**  
    + Identification of OsbHLH133 as a regulator of iron distribution between roots and shoots in Oryza sativa
    + Insertional inactivation of OsbHLH133 (bhlh133) resulted in growth retardation, with enhanced Fe concentration seen in shoots, and reduced Fe concentration in roots
    + Overexpression of OsbHLH133 had the opposite effect, that is resulted in an enhanced Fe concentration in roots and reduced Fe concentration in shoots and also in xylem sap
