* **Key message**  
    + Here we report the isolation and characterization of MONOCULM 1 (MOC1), a gene that is important in the control of rice tillering
    + The moc1 mutant plants have only a main culm without any tillers owing to a defect in the formation of tiller buds
    + A large genomic region surrounding the MONOCULM1 (MOC1) locus was chosen for study in 14 Oryza species, including 10 diploids and 4 allotetraploids
    + Ghd8 up-regulated MOC1, a key gene controlling tillering and branching; this increased the number of tillers, primary and secondary branches, thus producing 50% more grains per plant
    + To further elucidate the molecular mechanism of MOC1 involved in the regulation of rice tillering, we performed a yeast-two-hybrid screening to identify MOC1 interacting proteins (MIPs)
    + In-depth characterization of the context of MIP1 and MOC1 would further our understanding of molecular regulatory mechanisms of rice tillering
    + We show that TE coexpresses with MOC1 in the axil of leaves, where the APC/C(TE) complex mediates the degradation of MOC1 by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway, and consequently downregulates the expression of the meristem identity gene Oryza sativa homeobox 1, thus repressing axillary meristem initiation and formation
    + The MONOCULM 1 (MOC1) gene is the first identified key regulator controlling rice tiller number; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated
    + Rice MONOCULM 1 (MOC1) and its orthologues LS/LAS (lateral suppressor in tomato and Arabidopsis) are key promoting factors of shoot branching and tillering in higher plants
    + MOC1 encodes a putative GRAS family nuclear protein that is expressed mainly in the axillary buds and functions to initiate axillary buds and to promote their outgrowth
    + Our previous study has demonstrated that the MONOCULM1 (MOC1) gene is a key component that controls the formation of rice tiller buds
    + Novel function of a putative MOC1 ortholog associated with spikelet number per spike in common wheat.
    + Tomato Ls, Arabidopsis LAS and rice MOC1 are orthologous genes regulating axillary meristem initiation and outgrowth
