* **Key message**  
    + The accumulation of OsMGD mRNA in both FR13A and IR42 was also increased by ethephon, gibberellin, drought and salt treatment, but cold stress had no effect on the expression of the gene
    + Furthermore, the enhanced expression of OsMGD may relate to photosynthesis, and play an important role during submergence
    + Time-course studies showed that the expression of OsMGD in the rice cultivars FR13A and IR42 (submergence-susceptive cultivar) during submergence was gradually increased and that expression in FR13A was higher than in IR42
    + These results suggest that the expression of OsMGD mRNA requires benzyladenine or illumination, and that the process is also mediated by ethephon and gibberellin
