    + __OsIRO2__, __OsPRI1__, [POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 OsPRI1 positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.%5BTitle%5D),  Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assay results suggested that OsPRI1 binds to the OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 promoters
