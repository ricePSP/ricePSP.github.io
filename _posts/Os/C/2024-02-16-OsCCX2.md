    + [A rice tonoplastic calcium exchanger, OsCCX2 mediates Ca2+/cation transport in yeast.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A rice tonoplastic calcium exchanger, OsCCX2 mediates Ca2+/cation transport in yeast.%5BTitle%5D), 2015, Sci Rep.

* **Key message**  
    + In contrast to AtCCXs, OsCCX2 expressing K667 yeast cells show tolerance towards excess Na(+), Li(+), Fe(2+), Zn(2+) and Co(2+) and suggest its ability to transport both mono as well as divalent cations in yeast
    + OsCCX2 can be used as potential candidate for enhancing the abiotic stress tolerance in plants as well as for phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soil
    + Rice genome encode four CCXs and only OsCCX2 transcript showed differential expression under abiotic stresses and Ca(2+) starvation conditions
    + A rice tonoplastic calcium exchanger, OsCCX2 mediates Ca(2+)/cation transport in yeast.
