* **Key message**  
    + Male semi-sterility in this heterozygous complex locus is caused by abortion of pollen carrying SaM(-)
    + Here we show that a locus for indica-japonica hybrid male sterility, Sa, comprises two adjacent genes, SaM and SaF, encoding a small ubiquitin-like modifier E3 ligase-like protein and an F-box protein, respectively
    + This allele-specific gamete elimination results from a selective interaction of SaF(+) with SaM(-), a truncated protein, but not with SaM(+) because of the presence of an inhibitory domain, although SaM(+) is required for this male sterility
    + Our results firmly proved that SaF and SaM are required for the hybrid male sterility, but are not essential for pollen development
    + Here we showed that silencing of SaF or SaM by RNA interference restored male fertility in indica-japonica hybrids with heterozygous Sa
