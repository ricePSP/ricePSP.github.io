* **Key message**  
    + The suppressed telomere clustering in homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis 1 (pair1) zygo1 and rice completion of meiotic recombination (Oscom1) zygo1 double mutants, together with the altered localization of OsSAD1 (a SUN protein associated with the nuclear envelope) in zygo1 showed that ZYGO1 has a significant function in bouquet formation
    + Therefore, we propose that ZYGO1 mediates bouquet formation to efficiently promote homolog pairing, synapsis, and CO formation in rice meiosis
    + Furthermore, crossover (CO) formation was disturbed, and foci of Human enhancer of invasion 10 (HEI10) were restricted to the partially-synapsed chromosome regions, indicating that CO reduction might be caused by the failure of full-length chromosome alignment in zygo1
