    + The amino acid residues predicted to line the active site of Os4BGlu12 are more similar to those of cyanogenic and flavonoid ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ²-glucosidases than oligosaccharide hydrolases, and it may function in defense, as well as in cell wall-derived oligosaccharide break-down

    + Here, high levels of Os4bglu12 transcripts were also detected in the shoot during germination, in the leaf sheath and stem of mature rice plants under normal growth conditions
    + The cDNA of the Os4bglu12 gene, which encodes a protein identical at 40 of 44 amino acid residues with the N-terminal sequence of a cell wall-bound enzyme previously purified from germinating rice, was isolated by RT-PCR from rice seedlings
    + To begin this analysis, Os4bglu12 beta-glucosidase was characterized and found to have high exoglucanase activity, consistent with a role in cell wall metabolism
    + Native Os4BGlu12 and its complex with 2,4-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-D-glucopyranoside (DNP2FG) were crystallized using 19% polyethylene glycol (3350 or 2000, respectively) in 0
