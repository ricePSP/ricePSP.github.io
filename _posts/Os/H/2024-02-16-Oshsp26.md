* **Key message**  
    + The Oshsp26 gene was expressed following heat stress: the transcript level was highest when rice leaves were treated at high temperatures for 2h at 42 degrees C, and the transcripts became detectable after 20min and reached a maximum level after 2h
    + Nakdong) cDNA clone, Oshsp26, encoding the chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein (smHSP) was isolated
    + Since MV treatment in the light leads to the generation of H(2)O(2) inside the chloroplast, it is likely that H(2)O(2) by itself acts to induce the expression of the Oshsp26 gene
    + We previously isolated and characterized a rice cDNA clone, Oshsp26, encoding a chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein that is expressed following oxidative or heat stress
    + Overexpression of a chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein OsHSP26 confers enhanced tolerance against oxidative and heat stresses in tall fescue
    + It was also found that the Oshsp26 gene was expressed following oxidative stress even in the absence of heat stress
    + These results suggest that the OsHSP26 protein plays an important role in the protection of PSII during heat and oxidative stress in vivo
