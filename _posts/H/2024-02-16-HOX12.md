* **Key message**  
    + Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.
    + In this study, we identified a dominant panicle enclosure mutant regulator of eui1 (ree1-D), which is caused by the activation of a homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor HOX12
    + Diminished HOX12 expression by RNA interference enhances the panicle exsertion, mimicking the eui1 phenotype
    + These results reveal a novel regulatory module that HOX12 acts directly through EUI1 to regulate panicle exsertion in rice
    + Quantification of GA levels in the uppermost internodes revealed that the HOX12 knockdown plants contain higher levels of the major biologically active GAs (such as GA1 and GA4) than these in the wild type
