* **Key message**  
    + In contrast with wild-type plants, OsMT2b-RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants had serious handicap in plant growth and root formation, whereas OsMT2b-overexpressing transformants were dwarfed and presented more adventitious roots and big lateral roots
    + Taken together, these results indicate a possible feedback regulation mechanism of OsMT2b to the level of endogenous cytokinins that is involved in root development and seed embryo germination of rice
    + Characteristic and expression analysis of a metallothionein gene, OsMT2b, down-regulated by cytokinin suggests functions in root development and seed embryo germination of rice
    + Transgenic plants overexpressing OsMT2b showed increased susceptibility to bacterial blight and blast fungus
    + Histochemical staining analysis of transgenic rice carrying OsMT2b::GUS chimeric gene showed that high-level GUS activity was detected in germinated embryos and at the meristematic part of other tissues during germination
    + OsMT2b was preferentially expressed in rice immature panicles, scutellum of germinating embryos, and primordium of lateral roots
    + A rice subfamily p2 (type 2) MT gene, OsMT2b, has been shown previously to exhibit the most abundant gene expression in young rice seedling
    + We found that the OsMT2b gene is strongly and differentially expressed in germinated rice embryos during seed germination and seedling development
    + We found that the expression of a metallothionein gene (OsMT2b) was synergically down-regulated by OsRac1 and rice (Oryza sativa) blast-derived elicitors
    + Here, we characterized rice (Oryza sativa) METALLOTHIONEIN2b (OsMT2b) molecularly and found that its expression was down-regulated by cytokinins
