    + [LC069370](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/LC069370)

* **Key message**  
    + Similar to Lsi6, knockout of Lsi2 and Lsi3 also resulted in decreased distribution of Si to the panicles but increased Si to the flag leaf
    + Lsi3 was located in the parenchyma tissues between enlarged vascular bundles and diffuse vascular bundles
