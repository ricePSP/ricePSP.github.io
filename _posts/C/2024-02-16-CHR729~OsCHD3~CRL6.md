* **Key message**  
    + CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.
    + These results suggest that the rice CHD3 protein CHR729 plays an important role in many aspects of seedling development and controls this development via the gibberellin pathway
    + CHR729 encoded a nuclear protein and was expressed in almost all organs
    + Realtime RT-PCR analysis showed that CRL6 was most highly expressed in the stem base region where crown roots initiated
    + Histological analysis showed that CRL6 influences crown root formation by regulating primordial initiation and development
    + Our results provide evidence that CRL6 plays an important role in crown root development in rice via auxin-related signaling pathway
    + In addition, auxin-action inhibited phenotype was observed during crl6 development
    + Map-based cloning and subsequent complementation tests verified that the CRL6 gene encodes a member of the large chromodomain, helicase/ATPase, and DNA-binding domain (CHD) family protein
