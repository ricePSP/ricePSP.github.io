    + [Erect leaves caused by brassinosteroid deficiency increase biomass production and grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Erect leaves caused by brassinosteroid deficiency increase biomass production and grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D), 2006, Nat Biotechnol.

* **Key message**  
    + Here we show that the erect leaf phenotype of a rice brassinosteroid-deficient mutant, osdwarf4-1, is associated with enhanced grain yields under conditions of dense planting, even without extra fertilizer
    + Molecular and biochemical studies reveal that two different cytochrome P450s, CYP90B2/OsDWARF4 and CYP724B1/D11, function redundantly in C-22 hydroxylation, the rate-limiting step of brassinosteroid biosynthesis
    + Therefore, despite the central role of brassinosteroids in plant growth and development, mutation of OsDWARF4 alone causes only limited defects in brassinosteroid biosynthesis and plant morphology
