* **Key message**  
    + Northern blot analysis indicated that REP-2 mRNA was expressed in both maturing and germinating seeds
    + Incubation of the de-embryonated seeds in 10(-6) M gibberellic acid induced the production of large amounts of REP-1, whereas REP-2beta levels declined rapidly
    + Identification, cDNA cloning and possible roles of seed-specific rice asparaginyl endopeptidase, REP-2
    + Bcl-2 suppresses hydrogen peroxide-induced programmed cell death via OsVPE2 and OsVPE3, but not via OsVPE1 and OsVPE4, in rice
    + Moreover, we found that suppression of OsVPE3 caused decreased leaf width and guard cell length in rice
    + Suppression of OsVPE3 Enhances Salt Tolerance by Attenuating Vacuole Rupture during Programmed Cell Death and Affects Stomata Development in Rice.
    + Therefore, we concluded that OsVPE3 plays a crucial role in vacuole-mediated PCD and in stomatal development in rice
    + Survival rate and chlorophyll retention analyses showed that suppression of OsVPE3 clearly enhanced salt stress tolerance in transgenic rice compared with wild type
    + Taken together, these results indicated that suppression of OsVPE3 enhances salt tolerance by attenuating vacuole rupture during PCD
