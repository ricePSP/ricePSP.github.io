* **Key message**  
    + Leaf sheaths were found to contain higher levels of KOB1 protein than the blade portions of leaves
    + Yeast co-expressing PutAKT1 and the beta subunits (KPutB1 and KOB1) had better growth and higher K+-uptake ability than yeast expressing PutAKT1 alone
    + In contrast, yeast co-expressing the beta subunits (KPutB1 and KOB1) with OsAKT1 had slower growth and lower K+ uptake than yeast expressing OsAKT1 alone
    + Later-developing leaves on a rice plant were found to contain increasing levels of the protein with the flag leaf having the highest titer of KOB1
    + Expression studies indicated that KOB1 protein is more abundant in leaves than in either reproductive structures or roots
    + Ectopic expression of the K+ channel beta subunits from Puccinellia tenuiflora (KPutB1) and rice (KOB1) alters K+ homeostasis of yeast and Arabidopsis
