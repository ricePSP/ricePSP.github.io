* **Key message**  
    + Expression of the OsYSL16 promoter fused to the beta-glucuronidase gene showed that OsYSL16 is expressed in the root epidermis and vascular bundles of whole plants
    + Our results suggest that the function of OsYSL16 in Fe-homeostasis is to enable distribution of iron within a plant
    + Activation of rice Yellow Stripe1-Like 16 (OsYSL16) enhances iron efficiency
    + During germination, the rate of Fe-utilization from the seeds was higher in the OsYSL16 activation lines than in the WT seeds
    + Promoter fusions of OsYSL16 to beta-glucuronidase (GUS) showed that OsYSL16 was highly expressed in the vascular tissues of the root, leaf, and spikelet, and in leaf mesophyll cells
    + OsYSL16 has 85 % similarity to both OsYSL15 and the iron(II)-nicotianamine transporter OsYSL2
    + In the present study, we show that OsYSL16 functionally complemented a yeast mutant defective in iron uptake when grown on medium containing iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid, but not when grown on medium containing iron(II)-nicotianamine
    + OsYSL16-knockdown seedlings were smaller than wild-type seedlings when only iron(III)chloride was supplied as an iron source
    + The iron concentration in shoots of OsYSL16-knockdown plants was similar to that of the wild type; however, they showed more severe chlorosis than wild-type plants under iron-deficient conditions
    + Furthermore, OsYSL16-knockdown plants accumulated more iron in the vascular bundles of the leaves
    + Our results suggest that OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid via the vascular bundles
    + OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron
    + The Fe concentration in shoots was also higher in the OsYSL16 activation lines than in the WT
