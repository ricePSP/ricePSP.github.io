* **Key message**  
    + The expression of an auxin transporter (OsAUX1) and a tillering inhibitor (OsTB1) were downregulated by overexpression of OsmiR393, which suggested that a gene chain from OsmiR393 to rice tillering may be from OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 to OsAUX1, which affected the transportation of auxin, then to OsTB1, which finally controlled tillering
    + OsAUX1 controls lateral root initiation in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + The auxin influx carriers in Arabidopsis have been shown to control lateral root development and gravitropism, but little is known about these proteins in rice
    + Three OsAUX1 T-DNA insertion mutants and RNAi knockdown transgenic plants reduced lateral root initiation compared to WT plants
    + OsAUX1 overexpression plants exhibited increased lateral root initiation and OsAUX1 was highly expressed in lateral roots and lateral root primordia
    + Similarly, the auxin reporter, DR5-GUS, was expressed at lower levels in osaux1 than in the WT plants, which indicated that the auxin levels in the mutant roots had decreased
    + Overall, our results indicated that OsAUX1 was involved in polar auxin transport and functioned to control auxin-mediated lateral root initiation in rice
    + Polar auxin transport, mediated by influx and efflux transporters, controls many aspects of plant growth and development
    + Exogenous NAA treatment rescued the defective phenotype in osaux1-1 plants, whereas IAA and 2,4-D could not, which suggested that OsAUX1 was a putative auxin influx carrier
    + The transcript levels of several auxin-signaling genes and cell cycle genes significantly declined in osaux1, hinting that the regulatory role of OsAUX1 may be mediated by auxin-signaling and cell cycle genes
    + OsAUX1 expression in root hair cells is different from its paralogous gene, AtAUX1, expressed in non-hair cells
    + Taken together, our results indicate that OsAUX1 plays an important role in root development and in responses to Cd stress
    + However, OsAUX1 - like AtAUX1 - also localizes at the plasma membrane and seems to function as an auxin tranporter
    + Decreased auxin distribution and contents in osaux1 mutant result in reduction of OsCyCB1;1 expression and shortened PR, LR and RH under Cd stress, but can be rescued by the membrane-permeable auxin, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA)
    + Here, we characterize rice osaux1 mutants that have longer PR and shorter RH in hydroponic culture, and that are more sensitive to Cd stress compared to WT/Dongjin (DJ)
    + Cd contents in the osaux1 mutant were not altered but reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage was enhanced, further increasing the osaux1 mutant sensitivity to Cd stress
    + Moreover, protein localization of auxin transporters PIN1 homologs and GFP tagged OsAUX1 overlapped with DR5-VENUS during spikelet development, helping validate these auxin response reporters are reliable markers in rice
