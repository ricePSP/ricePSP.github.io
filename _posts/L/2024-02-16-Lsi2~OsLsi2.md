* **Key message**  
    + Immunostaining with Lsi1 and Lsi2 antibodies revealed a similar pattern of subcellular localization of these two Si transporters in both varieties; Lsi1 and Lsi2 were localized at the distal and proximal sides, respectively, of both exodermis and endodermis of the roots
    + Furthermore, in the rice mutants defective in the silicon efflux transporter Lsi2, arsenite transport to the xylem and accumulation in shoots and grain decreased greatly
    + Recent studies have shown that arsenite is taken up by rice (Oryza sativa) roots through two silicon transporters, Lsi1 (the aquaporin NIP2;1) and Lsi2 (an efflux carrier)
    + The expression of two Si transporter genes (Low silicon rice 1 [Lsi1] and Lsi2) investigated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed higher expression of both genes in Nipponbare than in Kasalath
    + Expression of Lsi2 in Xenopus oocytes did not result in influx transport activity for silicon, but preloading of the oocytes with silicon resulted in a release of silicon, indicating that Lsi2 is a silicon efflux transporter
    + By contrast, Lsi2 mutation had little effect on arsenite efflux to the external medium
    + Mutation in Lsi2 had a much greater impact on arsenic accumulation in shoots and grain in field-grown rice than Lsi1
    + Here we describe a previously uncharacterized gene, low silicon rice 2 (Lsi2), which has no similarity to Lsi1
    + There was a negative correlation between the expression level of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 and shoot Si accumulation when the rice seedlings were exposed to different Si supply conditions
    + A split root experiment showed that the expression of both OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 was also down-regulated in half the roots without direct Si exposure when the other half of the roots were exposed to Si
