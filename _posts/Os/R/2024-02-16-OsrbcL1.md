* **Key message**  
    + In this study, our findings regarding the regulation of GA irradiation-induced OsGIRP1 in relation to the levels of photosynthesis-related proteins such as OsrbcL1 and OsrbcS1 and hypersensitive responses of overexpressing plants to GR irradiation provide insight into the molecular functions of OsGIRP1 as a negative regulator in response to the stress of radiation
