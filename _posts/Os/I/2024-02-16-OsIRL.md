* **Key message**  
    + Our results strongly suggest the involvement of OsIRL in homeostasis of ROS
    + These results suggest that the expression of OsIRL is positively regulated by phytohormones such as JA, and negatively by phytohormones such as SA, ABA
    + Using Northern and Western blot analyses, the OsIRL gene and protein were shown to be down-regulated in young seedling roots treated with reduced glutathione (GSH) and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), known quenchers of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
    + Expression of OsIRL was induced by treatment with a fungal elicitor and jasmonic acid as well as by inoculation with rice blast fungus
    + Results showed that the OsIRL transgenic rice line activated by ABA treatment was tolerant against MV and G/GO-induced stress in rice leave and suspension-cultured cells
    + A rice isoflavone reductase-like gene, OsIRL, is induced by rice blast fungal elicitor
    + Treatment with salicylic acid (SA, 5 mM) strongly inhibited expression of OsIRL in response to fungal elicitor and JA, while abscisic acid (ABA, 200 muM) also strongly antagonized OsIRL induction by JA, but had only a weak effect on induction by the fungal elicitor
