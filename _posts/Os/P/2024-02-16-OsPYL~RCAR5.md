* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic rice plants expressing OsPYL/RCAR5, a PYL/RCAR orthologue of rice, were found to be hypersensitive to ABA during seed germination and early seedling growth
    + A rice orthologue of the ABA receptor, OsPYL/RCAR5, is a positive regulator of the ABA signal transduction pathway in seed germination and early seedling growth
    + The constitutive expression of OsPYL/RCAR5 in rice driven by the Zea mays ubiquitin promoter induced the expression of many stress-responsive genes even under normal growth conditions and resulted in improved drought and salt stress tolerance in rice
    + A rice ABA signalling unit composed of OsPYL/RCAR5, OsPP2C30, SAPK2, and OREB1 for ABA-dependent gene regulation was further identified, via interaction assays and a transient gene expression assay
    + This suggests that, although exogenous expression of OsPYL/RCAR5 is able to improve abiotic stress tolerance in rice, fine regulation of its expression will be required to avoid deleterious effects on agricultural traits
    + OsPYL/RCARs thus are considered to be good candidate genes for improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in crops
    + This work demonstrates that the cytosolic ABA receptor OsPYL/RCAR5 in O
    + Previous work identified OsPYL/RCARs as functional ABA receptors regulating ABA-dependent gene expression in Oryza sativa

* **Connection**  
    + __OsDET1__, __OsPYL~RCAR5__, [OsDET1 Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsDET1 Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice%5BTitle%5D), These findings suggest that OsDET1 deficiency disturbs the CDD complex, which is responsible for ABA receptor (OsPYL) degradation, eventually leading to ABA sensitivity in rice
