* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsNAC2 regulates shoot branching in rice
    + Overexpression of OsNAC2 contributes tiller bud outgrowth, but does not affect tiller bud initiation
    + Here, an activation-tagging mutant Ostil1 (Oryza sativa tillering1) was characterized, which showed increased tillers, enlarged tiller angle and semidwarf phenotype
    + This suggests that OsNAC2 has potential utility for improving plant structure for higher light-use efficiency and higher yield potential in rice
    + OsNAC2 encoding a NAC transcription factor affects plant height through mediating the gibberellic acid pathway in rice.
    + Taken together, we proposed that OsNAC2 is a negative regulator of the plant height and flowering time, which acts by directly regulating key genes of the GA pathway in rice
    + With reduced yields under drought conditions at the flowering stage, OsNAC2 overexpression lines had lower resistance to high salt and drought conditions
    + The NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC2 regulates ABA-dependent genes and abiotic stress tolerance in rice.
    + We further confirmed that OsNAC2 directly binds the promoters of LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT 3 (OsLEA3) and Stress-Activated Protein Kinases 1 (OsSAPK1), two marker genes in the abiotic stress and ABA response pathways, respectively
    + Our results suggest that in rice OsNAC2 regulates both abiotic stress responses and ABA-mediated responses, and acts at the junction between the ABA and abiotic stress pathways
    + Overexpression of OsNAC2 dramatically accelerated leaf senescence, whereas its knockdown lines showed a delay in leaf senescence
    + Additionally, reduced OsNAC2 expression leads to about 10% increase in the grain yield of RNAi lines
    + Moreover, ectopic expression of OsNAC2 leads to an increase in ABA levels via directly upregulating expression of ABA biosynthetic genes (OsNCED3 and OsZEP1) as well as downregulating the ABA catabolic gene (OsABA8ox1)
    + Interestingly, OsNAC2 is upregulated by a lower level of ABA but downregulated by a higher level of ABA, indicating a feedback repression of OsNAC2 by ABA
