* **Key message**  
    + Morphological observation revealed that the formation of tiller buds was disrupted in moc3
    + The expression of MOC3 was induced by cytokinins and defection of MOC3 affected the expression of several two-component cytokinin response regulators, OsRRs and ORRs
    + Homeobox Is Pivotal for OsWUS Controlling Tiller Development and Female Fertility in Rice.
    + OsWUS has recently been shown to be a transcription factor gene critical for tiller development and fertility in rice
    + Map-based cloning revealed that the mutant phenotypes were caused by a mutation in OsWUS Compared with the two previously reported null allelic mutants of OsWUS (tab1-1 and moc3-1), which could produce partial N-terminal peptides of OsWUS, the srt1 protein contained a deletion of only seven amino acids within the conserved homeobox domain of OsWUS
