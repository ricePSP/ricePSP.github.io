* **Key message**  
    + Since Hrd3/SEL1L recognizes unfolded proteins in yeast and mammalian protein quality control systems, the role of OsHrd3 in protein quality control in rice endosperm was investigated
    + Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that OsHrd3 interacts with components of the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase complex such as OsOS-9 and OsHrd1 in rice protoplasts
    + OsHrd3 is necessary for maintaining the quality of endoplasmic reticulum-derived protein bodies in rice endosperm.
    + Endosperm-specific suppression of OsHrd3 in transgenic rice reduced the levels of polyubiquitinated proteins and resulted in unfolded protein responses (UPRs) in the endosperm, suggesting that OsHrd3-mediated polyubiquitination plays an important role in ER quality control
