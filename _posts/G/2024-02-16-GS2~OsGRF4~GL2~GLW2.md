* **Key message**  
    + A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice
    + Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a dominant QTL, GRAIN SIZE ON CHROMOSOME 2 (GS2), which encodes Growth-Regulating Factor 4 (OsGRF4), a transcriptional regulator.
    + GS2 localizes to the nucleus and may act as a transcription activator.
    + The increase of GS2 expression leads to larger cells and increased numbers of cells, which thus enhances grain weight and yield.
    + We demonstrate that a 2ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂbp substitution mutation in GS2 perturbs OsmiR396-directed regulation of GS2, resulting in large and heavy grains and increased grain yield
    + Further results reveal that GS2 interacts with the transcription coactivitors OsGIF1/2/3, and overexpression of OsGIF1 increases grain size and weight
    + Because of the mutation, GL2 has a moderately increased expression level, which consequently activates brassinosteroid responses by upregulating a large number of brassinosteroid-induced genes to promote grain development
    + OsGRF4 controls grain shape, panicle length and seed shattering in rice.
    + Higher expression of OsGRF4 is correlated with larger grain, longer panicle and lower seed shattering
    + Further research showed that OsGRF4 regulated two cytokinin dehydrogenase precursor genes (CKX5 and CKX1) resulting in increased cytokinin levels, which might affect the panicle traits
    + High storage capacity and moderate seed shattering of OsGRF4 may be useful in high-yield breeding and mechanized harvesting of rice
    + The mutation in OsGRF4 perturbs the OsmiR396 target regulation of OsGRF4, generating a larger grain size and enhanced grain yield

    + __GS2~OsGRF4~GL2~GLW2__, __GSK2__, [Control of grain size and rice yield by GL2-mediated brassinosteroid responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Control of grain size and rice yield by GL2-mediated brassinosteroid responses%5BTitle%5D), Furthermore, we found that GSK2, the central negative regulator of rice brassinosteroid signalling, directly interacts with OsGRF4 and inhibits its transcription activation activity to mediate the specific regulation of grain length by the hormone.
