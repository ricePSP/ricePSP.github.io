* **Key message**  
    + We conclude that OsRab5a plays an essential role in trafficking of storage protein to PBII, possibly as part of its function in organizing the endomembrane system in developing endosperm cells of rice
    + OsRab5a regulates endomembrane organization and storage protein trafficking in rice endosperm cells
    + These results indicate that the formation of the paramural bodies in glup4 endosperm was due to a significant disruption of endocytosis and membrane vesicular transport by Rab5a loss of function
    + Here, we report the isolation of a rice mutant, gpa1, that accumulates 57 kDa pro-glutelins in seeds and whose endosperm has a floury appearance
    + Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the gpa1 endosperm cells have an enlarged ER lumen and a smaller protein body II (PBII), and accumulated three types of newly generated subcellular structures
    + Moreover, a proportion of glutelins in the gpa1 endosperm cells were not delivered to PBII, and instead were mis-targeted to two of the newly generated structures or secreted
