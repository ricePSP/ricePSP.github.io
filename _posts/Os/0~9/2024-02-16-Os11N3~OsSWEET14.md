* **Key message**  
    + A knowledge-based molecular screen uncovers a broad spectrum OsSWEET14 resistance allele to bacterial blight from wild rice.
    + We show that this allele, which we call xa41(t), confers resistance against half of the tested Xoo strains representative of various geographic origins and genetic lineages, highlighting the selective pressure for the pathogen to accommodate with OsSWEET14 polymorphism and reciprocally the apparent limited possibilities for the host to create variability at this particular S gene
    + In a proof-of-principle experiment, we screened a germplasm of 169 rice accessions for polymorphism in the promoter of the major bacterial blight susceptibility (S) gene OsSWEET14 which encodes a sugar transporter targeted by numerous strains of X
    + Surprisingly, although indels within TalC EBE prevented OsSWEET14 induction in response to BAI3 wild-type bacteria relying on TalC, loss of TalC-responsiveness failed to confer resistance to this strain
