* **Key message**  
    + About half of the waf1 mutants showed seedling lethality due to defects in SAM maintenance, but the rest survived to the reproductive phase and exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes in leaf morphology and floral development
    + The rice wavy leaf1 (waf1) mutant has been identified as an embryonic mutant resembling shoot organization1 (sho1) and sho2, homologs of a loss-of-function mutant of DICER-LIKE4 and a hypomorphic mutant of ARGONAUTE7, respectively, which both act in the ta-siRNA production pathway
    + Our results indicate that stabilization of small RNAs by WAF1 is indispensable for rice development, especially for SAM maintenance and leaf morphogenesis governed by the ta-siRNA pathway

* **Connection**  
    + __SHO1~OsDCL4__, __WAF1~OsHEN1__, [DCL2 is highly expressed in the egg cell in both rice and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=DCL2 is highly expressed in the egg cell in both rice and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D), In this article, we show that OsDCL2, OsDCL4, and OsHEN1 are preferentially expressed in the egg cell
