* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, the pollen that developed was completely sterile, which was correlated with the altered expression of two Rf (fertility restorer)-like genes that encode pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins OsPPR676 and OsPPR920, translational initiation factors OseIF3e and OseIF3h, and the heat shock protein OsHSP82
    + These results suggested although OseIF3e is not a &quot;functional core&quot; subunit of eIF3, it still plays crucial roles in rice growth and development, in combination with other factors
    + Repression of OseIF3e led to defects in pollen maturation but did not affect pollen mitosis
    + We proposed a pathway by which OseIF3e influence organ size and pollen maturation in rice, providing an opportunity to optimize plant architecture for crop breeding
