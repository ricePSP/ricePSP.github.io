* **Key message**  
    + IPI1 promotes the degradation of IPA1 in panicles while it stabilizes IPA1 in shoot apexes
    + Moreover, IPI1 could ubiquitinate IPA1-mediated complex with different polyubiquitin chains, adding K48-linked polyubiquitin chains in panicles and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains in the shoot apex
    + Consistent with these findings, the ipi1 loss-of-function mutants showed markedly altered plant architecture, including more tillers, enlarged panicles, and increased yield per plant
    + These results demonstrate that IPI1 affects plant architecture through precisely tuning IPA1 protein levels in different tissues in rice, and provide new insight into the tissue-specific regulation of plant architecture and important genetic resources for molecular breeding applications
