* **Key message**  
    + Here we demonstrated that rice LC2 (OsVIL3) and OsVIL2 (two OsVILs, possible components of PRC2 complex) promote rice flowering
    + LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF
    + Our results showed that expressions of LC2 and OsVIL2 are induced by SD (short-day) conditions and both lc2 mutant and OsVIL2-RNAi lines display delayed heading date, consistent with the reduced expression levels of Hd1 and Hd3a
    + Insertion mutations in OsVIL2 caused late flowering under both long and short days
    + As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression
    + Thus, we conclude that OsVIL2 functions together with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1
    + OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice
