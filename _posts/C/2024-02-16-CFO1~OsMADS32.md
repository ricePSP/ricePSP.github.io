* **Key message**  
    + In this study, we characterized a MIKC-type MADS box gene, CHIMERIC FLORAL ORGANS (CFO1), which plays a key role in the regulation of floral organ identity in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + The cfo1 mutant displayed defective marginal regions of the palea, chimeric floral organs, and ectopic floral organs
    + The expression domains of CFO1 were mainly restricted to the marginal region of the palea and inner floral organs
    + The floral organ identity gene DROOPING LEAF (DL) was expressed ectopically in all defective organs of cfo1 flowers
    + Double mutant analysis revealed that loss of DL function mitigated some of the defects of floral organs in cfo1 flowers
    + We propose that the CFO1 gene plays a pivotal role in maintaining floral organ identity through negative regulation of DL expression
    + OsMADS32 interacts with PI-like proteins and regulates rice flower development.
    + OsMADS32 is a monocot specific MIKC(c) type MADS-box gene that plays an important role in regulating rice floral meristem and organs identity, a crucial process for reproductive success and rice yield
    + This work provides new insight into the mechanism by which OsMADS32 regulates rice lodicule and stamen identity, by interaction with two PI-like proteins via its K domain
    + OsMADS32 interacts with PI-like proteins and regulates rice flower development
