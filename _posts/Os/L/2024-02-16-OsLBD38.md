* **Publication**  
    + [OsLBD37 and OsLBD38, two class II type LBD proteins, are involved in the regulation of heading date by controlling the expression of Ehd1 in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsLBD37 and OsLBD38, two class II type LBD proteins, are involved in the regulation of heading date by controlling the expression of Ehd1 in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2017, Biochem Biophys Res Commun.

* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of OsLBD37 and OsLBD38 separately causes delayed heading date and increased yield
    + Both OsLBD37 and OsLBD38 are expressed in rhythmic pattern, and their proteins are localized in the nucleus
    + Further analysis revealed that OsLBD37 and OsLBD38 delayed heading date by down-regulating the expression of the florigen genes Hd3a and RFT1 through key regulator of heading date Ehd1
    + OsLBD37 and OsLBD38 are two class II type LBD proteins, function as transcriptional activators
