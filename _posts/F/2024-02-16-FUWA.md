* **Key message**  
    + FUWA encodes a NHL domain containing protein, with a preferential expression in meristems of root, shoot apical and inflorescence, where it restricts excessive cell division
    + We further confirm a highly conserved role of FUWA homologues in determining panicle architecture and grain development in rice, maize and sorghum through genetic transformation
    + Strikingly, knocking-down FUWA transcription level by RNA interference leads to an erect panicle and an increased grain size in both indica and japonica genetic backgrounds
    + Sequence analysis revealed that FUWA has undergone a bottleneck effect and become fixed in landraces and modern cultivars during domestication and breeding
