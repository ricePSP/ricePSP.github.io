* **Key message**  
    + RNA analysis showed that transcripts of OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 were present in all tissues examined, but their expression was differentially regulated, at least in roots and maturing seeds
    + We have isolated full-length cDNAs for two distinct isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), designated OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 from a rice shoot cDNA library
