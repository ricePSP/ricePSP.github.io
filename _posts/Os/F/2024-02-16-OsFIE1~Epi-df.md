* **Key message**  
    + Here, we identify a gain-of-function epi-allele (Epi-df) of rice (Oryza sativa) FIE1; this allele causes a dwarf stature and various floral defects that are inherited in a dominant fashion
    + OsFIE1 is expressed only in endosperm; the maternal copy is expressed while the paternal copy is not active
    + Imprinted Gene OsFIE1 Modulates Rice Seed Development by Influencing the Nutrient Metabolism and Modifying Genome H3K27me3.
    + The RNAi of OsFIE1 and homozygous T-DNA insertion mutant osfie1 led to smaller seed, delayed embryo development, smaller aleurone layer cell, and decreased seed set rate
    + OsFIE1 specifically expressed in endosperm, and mRNA of OsFIE1 also enriched in inner seed coat with the corresponding PcG members of OsiEZ1 and OsCLF
    + Meanwhile, the contents of seed storage proteins and Ile, Leu, and Val were decreased, accompanied with the down-regulation of multiple transcription factors, storage protein synthesis and amino acid metabolism related genes in OsFIE1-RNAi lines and osfie1
