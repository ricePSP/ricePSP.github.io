* **Key message**  
    + The expression of water channel protein RWC3 mRNA was increased in upland rice at the early response (up to 4 h) to the 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 treatment, whereas there was no significant expression changes in lowland rice
    + Partial silencing of the water channel genes, OsPIP1;1 and OsPIP1;3, reduced seed germination while over-expression of OsPIP1;3 promoted seed germination under water-stress conditions
    + Moreover, spatial expression analysis indicates that OsPIP1;3 is expressed predominantly in embryo during seed germination
    + Exogenous NO stimulated the transcription of OsPIP1;1, OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;8 in germinating seeds
    + The up-regulation of RWC3 in upland rice fits well with the knowledge that upland rice adopts the mechanism of drought avoidance
    + These results indicated that RWC3 probably played a role in drought avoidance in rice
    + The role of aquaporin RWC3 in drought avoidance in rice
