* **Key message**  
    + MODD mediates deactivation and degradation of OsbZIP46 to negatively regulate ABA signaling and drought resistance in rice.
    + MODD was induced by ABA and drought stress, but the induction was much slower than that of OsbZIP46
    + In contrast to OsbZIP46, MODD negatively regulates ABA signaling and drought tolerance, and inhibits the expression of OsbZIP46 target genes
    + MODD promotes OsbZIP46 degradation via interaction with the U-box type ubiquitin E3 ligase OsPUB70
    + Here, we report an OsbZIP46-interacting protein, MODD (Mediator of OsbZIP46 deactivation and degradation), which is homologous to the Arabidopsis thaliana ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5)-binding protein AFP
