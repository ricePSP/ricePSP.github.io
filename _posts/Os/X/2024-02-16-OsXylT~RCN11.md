    + RCN11 also mediates root aerenchyma formation under oxygen-deficient conditions and ABA sensitivity during seed germination
    + ) mutant reduced culm number11 (rcn11) showed that RCN11 controls growth of plants exposed to abnormal temperature, salinity and drought conditions
    + The rice RCN11 gene encodes ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ²1,2-xylosyltransferase and is required for plant responses to abiotic stresses and phytohormones.
    + A root development comparison between rcn1 and rcn11 in young seedlings represented that rcn11 reduced crown root number and elongation, whereas rcn1 reduced lateral root density and elongation
    + Thus, rcn11 will shed new light on vegetative growth control under low temperature
    + Since the shoot architecture of the rcn11 was very similar to that of the rcn1, we examined whether RCN11 is involved in RCN1/OsABCG5-associated vegetative growth control
    + The rcn1 rcn11 phenotype suggests that RCN11 acts on vegetative growth independent of RCN1/OsABCG5
