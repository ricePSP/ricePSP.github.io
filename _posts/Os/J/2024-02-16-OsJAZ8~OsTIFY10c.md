* **Key message**  
    + Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice
    + JA treatment caused OsJAZ8 degradation and this degradation was dependent on the 26S proteasome pathway
    + On the basis of these data, we conclude that JA plays an important role in resistance to Xoo, and OsJAZ8 acts as a repressor of JA signaling in rice
    + Expression of OsJAZ8, a rice jasmonate ZIM-domain protein, was highly up-regulated by JA
    + Furthermore, OsJAZ8DeltaC negatively regulated the JA-induced resistance to Xoo in rice
    + A large-scale analysis using a rice DNA microarray revealed that overexpression of OsJAZ8DeltaC altered the expression of JA-responsive genes, including defense-related genes, in rice

* **Connection**  
    + __OsCOI1~OsCOI1a__, __OsJAZ8~OsTIFY10c__, [Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice%5BTitle%5D), OsJAZ8 interacted with a putative OsCOI1, which is a component of the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine-dependent manner
