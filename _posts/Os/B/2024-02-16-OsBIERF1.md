* **Key message**  
    + Expression of OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 was induced by treatments with BTH and salicylic acid, chemical inducers capable of inducing disease resistance response in rice
    + We isolated and identified four rice genes, OsBIERF1 to OsBIERF4 (Oryza sativa benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced ethylene responsive transcriptional factors (ERF)) and analyzed their expressions in rice disease resistance response and under various abiotic stress conditions
    + In the BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 was further induced by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast fungus, as compared with those in water-treated seedlings
    + Moreover, OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 were also up-regulated by salt, cold, drought and wounding
