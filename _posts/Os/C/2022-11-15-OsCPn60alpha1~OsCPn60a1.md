* **Publication**  
    + [OsCpn60alpha1, encoding the plastid chaperonin 60alpha subunit, is essential for folding of rbcL](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsCpn60alpha1, encoding the plastid chaperonin 60alpha subunit, is essential for folding of rbcL%5BTitle%5D), 2013, Mol Cells.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + The oscpn60alpha1 mutant had a pale-green phenotype at the seedling stage and development ceased after the fourth leaf appeared
    + This demonstrated that OsCpn60alpha1 is required for the folding of rbcL and that failure of that process is seedling-lethal
    + Transiently expressed OsCpn60alpha1:GFP fusion protein was localized to the chloroplast stroma
