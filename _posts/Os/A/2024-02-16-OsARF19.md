* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + OsARF19 is expressed in various organs including lamina joint and strongly induced by auxin and BR
    + Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrate that OsARF19 binds to the promoter of OsGH3-5 and brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (OsBRI1) directing their expression
