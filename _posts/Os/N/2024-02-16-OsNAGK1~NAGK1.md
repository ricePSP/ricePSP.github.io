* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [AK104439](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AK104439)

* **Key message**  
    + Transient expression of OsGlnB cDNA or OsNAGK1 cDNA fused with sGFP in rice leaf blades strongly suggested that the PII-like protein as well as OsNAGK1 protein is located in chloroplasts
    + Both OsGlnB and OsNAGK1 genes were expressed in roots, leaf blades, leaf sheaths and spikelets of rice, and these two genes were coordinately expressed in leaf blades during the life span
