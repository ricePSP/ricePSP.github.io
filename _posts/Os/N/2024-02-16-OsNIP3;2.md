* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Knockout of OsNIP3;2 significantly decreased As concentration in the roots, but had little effect on shoot As concentration
    + The Nodulin 26-like intrinsic membrane protein OsNIP3;2 is involved in arsenite uptake by lateral roots in rice.
    + Our results indicate that OsNIP3;2 is involved in As(III) uptake by lateral roots, but its contribution to As accumulation in the shoots is limited
