* **Key message**  
    + OsCOL4 null mutants flowered early under short or long days
    + In contrast, OsCOL4 activation-tagging mutants (OsCOL4-D) flowered late in either environment
    + By comparison, levels of Hd1, OsID1, OsMADS50, OsMADS51, and OsMADS56 transcripts were not significantly changed in oscol4 or OsCOL4-D, suggesting that OsCOL4 functions independently from previously reported flowering pathways
    + In osphyB mutants, OsCOL4 expression was decreased and osphyB oscol4 double mutants flowered at the same time as the osphyB single mutants, indicating OsCOL4 functions downstream of OsphyB
    + OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB
