* **Key message**  
    + Biochemically, OsPAP21b showed hydrolysis of several organophosphates at acidic pH and possessed sufficient thermostability befitting for high temperature rice ecosystems with acidic soils
    + Interestingly, OsPAP21b was revealed to be a secretory PAP and encodes a distinguishable major APase (acid phosphatase) isoform under low Pi in roots
    + In light of these evidences, present study strongly proposes OsPAP21b as a useful candidate for improving Pi acquisition and utilization in rice

* **Connection**  
    + __OsPAP21b__, __OsPHR2__, [Improvement of Phosphate Acquisition and Utilization by a Secretory Purple Acid Phosphatase OsPAP21b in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Improvement of Phosphate Acquisition and Utilization by a Secretory Purple Acid Phosphatase OsPAP21b in Rice.%5BTitle%5D), OsPAP21b was found to be under the transcriptional control of OsPHR2 and strictly regulated by plant Pi-status at both transcript and protein levels
