* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of GE promoted cell proliferation and enhanced rice plant growth and grain yield, but reduced embryo size, suggesting that GE is critical for coordinating rice embryo and endosperm development
    + The function of GE in each tissue is distinct, controlling cell size in the embryo and cell death in the endosperm
    + Post-embryonic growth of ge seedling was severely inhibited due to defective shoot apical meristem (SAM) maintenance
    + GE, which encodes CYP78A13, is predominantly expressed in the interfacing tissues of the both embryo and endosperm
    + In contrast to the loss-of-function mutant with large embryo and small endosperm, GE overexpression causes a small embryo and enlarged endosperm
    + A complementation analysis coupled with heterofertilization showed that complementation of ge mutation in either embryo or endosperm failed to restore the wild-type embryo/endosperm ratio
    + Among genes associated with embryo/endosperm size, REDUCED EMBRYO genes, whose loss-of-function causes a phenotype opposite to ge, are revealed to regulate endosperm size upstream of GE
    + To fully understand the embryo-endosperm size control, the genetic network of the related genes should be elucidated
    + However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying embryo and endosperm development remains largely unknown, particularly in rice, the model cereal
    + GE is expressed predominantly in the scutellar epithelium, the interface region between embryo and endosperm
    + Mutation of GE resulted in a large embryo in the seed, which was caused by excessive expansion of scutellum cells
    + Moreover, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtCYP78A10, a GE homolog, also produced bigger seeds, implying a conserved role for the CYP78A subfamily of P450s in regulating seed development
    + 2 showed that both can promote grain growth
    + Variations in CYP78A13 coding region influence grain size and yield in rice.
    + Grain size is one of the most important determinants of crop yield in cereals
    + Here, we identified a dominant mutant, big grain2 (bg2-D) from our enhancer-trapping population
    + Sequence search revealed that CYP78A13 has a paralogue Grain<U+2005>Length 3
    + Detailed examination of the transgenic plants with chimaeric constructs suggested that variation in CYP78A13 coding region is responsible for the variation of grain yield
    + Taken together, our results suggest that the variations in CYP78A13 in the indica varieties hold potential in rice breeding for application of grain yield improvement
