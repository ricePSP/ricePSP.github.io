* **Key message**  
    + OsNIP3;1, a rice boric acid channel, regulates boron distribution and is essential for growth under boron-deficient conditions
    + GFP-tagged OsNIP3;1 expressed in tobacco BY2 cells was localized to the plasma membrane.
    + Promoter-GUS analysis suggested that OsNIP3;1 is expressed mainly in exodermal cells and steles in roots, as well as in cells around the vascular bundles in leaf sheaths and pericycle cells around the xylem in leaf blades.
    + These data provide evidence that DTE1 is critical for vegetative growth and reproductive development in rice grown under B-deficient conditions
    + Map-based cloning revealed that dte1 encodes a NOD26-LIKE INTRINSIC PROTEIN orthologous to known B channel proteins AtNIP5;1 in Arabidopsis and TASSEL-LESS1 in maize
    + Subcellular localization showed DTE1 is mainly localized in the plasma membrane
