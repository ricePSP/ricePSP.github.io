* **Connection**  
    + __OsCATA__, __OsCATB__, [ABA controls H2O2 accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ABA controls H2O2 accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress%5BTitle%5D), Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB
    + __OsCATB__, __OsCATC~noe1__, [ABA controls H2O2 accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ABA controls H2O2 accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress%5BTitle%5D), Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB

    + __OsCATB__, __OsCATC~noe1__, [ABA controls H2O2 accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=ABA controls H2O2 accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress%5BTitle%5D), When ABA production was inhibited by using ABA biosynthesis inhibitors nordihydroguaiaretic acid and tungstate, expression of CATB was also subdued while CATC was enhanced under the water stress
