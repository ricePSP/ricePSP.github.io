* **Key message**  
    + eat1 exhibits delayed tapetal cell death and aborted pollen formation
    + EAT1 promotes tapetal cell death by regulating aspartic proteases during male reproductive development in rice
    + A novel rice bHLH transcription factor, DTD, acts coordinately with TDR in controlling tapetum function and pollen development

* **Connection**  
    + __DTD~EAT1__, __TIP2~bHLH142__, [The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.%5BTitle%5D), We revealed that TIP2 acts upstream of TDR and EAT1 and directly regulates the expression of TDR and EAT1.
    + __DTC1__, __DTD~EAT1__, [Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 DTC1 Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 DTC1 Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.%5BTitle%5D), Moreover, levels of DTC1 transcripts are diminished in udt1, tdr, and eat1 anthers
    + __DTD~EAT1__, __OsTDF1__, [The functional analysis of OsTDF1 reveals a conserved genetic pathway for tapetal development between rice and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The functional analysis of OsTDF1 reveals a conserved genetic pathway for tapetal development between rice and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D), The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that OsTDF1 acts downstream of UDT1 and upstream of TDR, EAT1, OsMYB103 and PTC1 in rice, suggesting that the genetic pathway for tapetum development is generally conserved between rice and Arabidopsis
    + __DTD~EAT1__, __TIP2~bHLH142__, [Tightly Controlled Expression of bHLH142 Is Essential for Timely Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Tightly Controlled Expression of bHLH142 Is Essential for Timely Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development in Rice.%5BTitle%5D),  We previously showed that knockout of bHLH142 in rice (Oryza sativa) causes pollen sterility by interrupting tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) and bHLH142 coordinates with TDR to modulate the expression of EAT1
