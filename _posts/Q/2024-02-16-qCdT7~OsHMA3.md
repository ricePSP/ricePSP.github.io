* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, we isolated OsHMA3, a gene encoding a tonoplast-localized Cd transporter from Jarjan
    + * In this study, using positional cloning and transgenic strategies, heavy metal ATPase 3 (OsHMA3) was identified as the gene that controls root-to-shoot Cd translocation rates
    + * The allele of OsHMA3 that confers high root-to-shoot Cd translocation rates (OsHMA3mc) encodes a defective P(1B) -ATPase transporter
    + * We propose that the root cell cytoplasm of Cd-overaccumulating rice plants has more Cd available for loading into the xylem as a result of the lack of OsHMA3-mediated transportation of Cd to the vacuoles
    + OsHMA3, a P1B-type of ATPase affects root-to-shoot cadmium translocation in rice by mediating efflux into vacuoles
    + Our results indicated that OsHMA3 from the low Cd-accumulating cultivar limits translocation of Cd from the roots to the above-ground tissues by selectively sequestrating Cd into the root vacuoles
    + Rice OsHMA3 is a vacuolar cadmium (Cd) transporter belonging to the P1B-ATPase family and has a long (273aa) C-terminal region
    + Functional analysis of the C-terminal region of the vacuolar cadmium-transporting rice OsHMA3
    + The OsHMA3 protein was localized in all roots cells, but the sequence has a mutation leading to loss of function
    + Therefore, failure to sequester Cd into the root vacuoles by OsHMA3 is probably responsible for high Cd accumulation in Jarjan
    + Overexpression of OsHMA3 selectively reduces Cd accumulation in the grain
    + Taken together, overexpression of OsHMA3 is an efficient way to reduce Cd accumulation in the grain and to enhance Cd tolerance in rice
    + As a member of the heavy metal ATPase (HMA) family, OsHMA3 is a tonoplast-localized transporter for Cd in the roots of rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Overexpression of OsHMA3 enhances Cd tolerance and expression of Zn transporter genes in rice.
    + Further characterization in the present study revealed that overexpression of OsHMA3 also enhances the tolerance to toxic Cd
    + A loss-of-function allele of OsHMA3 associated with high cadmium accumulation in shoots and grain of Japonica rice cultivars.
    + Our study has identified a new loss-of-function allele of OsHMA3 in Japonica rice cultivars leading to high Cd accumulation in shoots and grain
