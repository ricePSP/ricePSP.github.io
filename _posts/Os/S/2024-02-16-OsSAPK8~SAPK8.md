* **Key message**  
    + We have shown recently that three members of the rice SnRK2 protein kinase family, SAPK8, SAPK9 and SAPK10, are activated by ABA signal as well as by hyperosmotic stress
    + Protein kinase OsSAPK8 functions as an essential activator of S-type anion channel OsSLAC1, which is nitrate-selective in rice.
    + Here, we report that protein kinase OsSAPK8 interacts with and activates OsSLAC1 mainly by phosphorylating serine 129 (S129) of OsSLAC1, and this phosphorylating site corresponds to the specific phosphorylating site serine 120 (S120) of AtSLAC1 for AtOST1
