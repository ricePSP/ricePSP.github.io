* **Key message**  
    + Taken together, our results provide evidence that OsMRE11 performs a function essential for maintaining the normal HR process and inhibiting non-homologous recombination during meiosis
    + Immunofluorescence studies further demonstrated that OsMRE11 is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing but is dispensable for meiotic DSB formation
    + We found that OsMRE11 protein was located on meiotic chromosomes from interphase to late pachytene
    + The OsMRE11-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed
