* **Key message**  
    + oral development in antisense plants, as well as leaf emergence measurement indicating delayed leaf development under OsPIPK1 deficiency, a common phenotype observed with earlier flowering
    + RT-PCR analysis indicated that OsPIPK1 was expressed almost constitutively in roots, shoots, stems, leaves and flowers, and upregulated following treatment with plant hormones or application of various stresses
    + RT-PCR analysis and cDNA chip technology were used to examine transcripts of various genes in the transgenic plants and the results showed altered transcriptions of several flowering-time or - identity related genes, suggesting that OsPIPK1 is involved in rice heading through regulation of
