* **Key message**  
    + Taken together, our results show that OsFRDL4 is an Al-induced citrate transporter localized at the plasma membrane of rice root cells and is one of the components of high Al tolerance in rice
    + Knockout of OsFRDL4 resulted in decreased Al tolerance and decreased citrate secretion compared with the wild-type rice, but did not affect citrate concentration in the xylem sap
    + Furthermore, the OsFRDL4 expression was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor for Al tolerance
    + Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between OsFRDL4 expression level and the amount of citrate secretion in rice cultivars that are differing in Al tolerance
    + The expression level of the OsFRDL4 gene in roots was very low in the absence of Al, but was greatly enhanced by Al after short exposure
    + Immunostaining showed that OsFRDL4 was localized in all cells in the root tip
    + Analysis with chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSL) derived from Nipponbare (high OsFRDL4 expression) and Kasalath (low OsFRDL4 expression) revealed that differential expression of OsFRDL4 is responsible for the QTL for Al tolerance detected previously on chromosome 1
