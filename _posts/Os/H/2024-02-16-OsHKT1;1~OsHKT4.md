* **Key message**  
    + The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 might contribute to accumulation of Na+ in old leaves under salt stress
    + Yeast expressions of OsHKT1 and OsHKT4 proved that they are Na+ transporters of high and low affinity, respectively, which are sensitive to K+ and Ba2+
    + In roots, the expressions were much lower than in shoots, except for OsHKT4 and OsHKT1 in K+-starved plants
    + OsHKT1;1 was expressed mainly in the phloem of leaf blades and up-regulated in response to salt stress
    + Taken together, these results suggest that OsHKT1;1 has a role in controlling Na+ concentration and preventing sodium toxicity in leaf blades, and is regulated by the OsMYBc transcription factor
    + The OsHKT1;1 Transporter is Involved in Salt Tolerance and Regulated by an MYB-Type Transcription Factor.
    + Using a yeast one-hybrid approach, a novel MYB coiled-coil type transcription factor, OsMYBc, was found to bind to the OsHKT1;1 promoter
    + The oshkt1;1 mutant plants displayed hypersensitivity to salt stress
    + Knockout of OsMYBc resulted in a reduction in NaCl-induced expression of OsHKT1;1 and salt sensitivity
