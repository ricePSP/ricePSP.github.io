* **Key message**  
    + HOTHEAD-Like HTH1 is Involved in Anther Cutin Biosynthesis and is Required for Pollen Fertility in Rice.
    + Rice plants with HTH1 suppression through CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and RNA interference (RNAi) displayed defective anther wall and aborted pollen
    + Our results suggested that HTH1 is involved in cutin biosynthesis and is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice
