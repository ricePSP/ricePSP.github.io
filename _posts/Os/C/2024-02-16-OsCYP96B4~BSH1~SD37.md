* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + The mutant exhibits the defects in cell elongation and pollen germination, which can be complemented by the wild type OsCYP96B4 and be rescued by remobilization of the Ds element with the presence of the transposase Activator (Ac)
    + The oscyp96b4 mutant phenotype could not be rescued by all the tested phytohormones and it was found that OsCYP96B4 reduced plant height in a transcript dosage dependent manner
    + Oryza sativa cytochrome P450 family member OsCYP96B4 reduces plant height in a transcript dosage dependent manner
    + METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report a novel semi-dwarf rice mutant, in which a single copy of transposon dissociator (Ds) was inserted into the gene OsCYP96B4 (Oryza sativa Cytochrome P450 96B4)
    + CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The oscyp96b4 mutant is a novel rice semi-dwarf mutant
    + Our data suggest that OsCYP96B4 might be involved in lipid metabolism and regulate cell elongation
    + BRITTLE SHEATH1 encoding OsCYP96B4 is involved in secondary cell wall formation in rice.
