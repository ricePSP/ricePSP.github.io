* **Key message**  
    + We isolated a pollen-preferential gene, RICE IMMATURE POLLEN 1 (RIP1), from a T-DNA insertional population of japonica rice that was trapped by a promoterless beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene
    + Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses confirmed that the RIP1 transcript was abundant at the late stages of pollen development
    + Microscopic analysis demonstrated that development in the rip1 pollen was delayed, starting at the early vacuolated stage
    + These results indicate that RIP1 is necessary for pollen maturation and germination
    + Therefore, RIP1 is probably a nuclear protein that may form a functional complex with other proteins and carry out essential cellular and developmental roles during the late stage of pollen formation
    + Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development
