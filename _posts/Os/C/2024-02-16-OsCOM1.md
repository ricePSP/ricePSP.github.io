* **Key message**  
    + Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
    + Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
    + These results provide direct evidence for the functions of OsCOM1 in promoting homologous synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis
