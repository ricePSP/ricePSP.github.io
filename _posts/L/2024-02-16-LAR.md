* **Key message**  
    + The genes encoding LAR were expressed in developing fruit, particularly in seeds, but had low expression in leaves
    + The two LAR genes had different patterns of expression in skin and seeds
    + During grape ripening, PA levels decreased in both skin and seeds, and expression of genes encoding ANR and LAR were no longer detected
    + We measured PA content and expression of genes encoding ANR, LAR, and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase in grape berries during development and in grapevine leaves, which accumulated PA throughout leaf expansion
