* **Publication**  
    + [Overexpression of stress-inducible OsBURP16, the beta subunit of polygalacturonase 1, decreases pectin content and cell adhesion and increases abiotic stress sensitivity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Overexpression of stress-inducible OsBURP16, the beta subunit of polygalacturonase 1, decreases pectin content and cell adhesion and increases abiotic stress sensitivity in rice%5BTitle%5D), 2014, Plant Cell Environ.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + All these results suggested that overexpression of OsBURP16 caused pectin degradation and affected cell wall integrity as well as transpiration rate, which decreased tolerance to abiotic stresses
    + Overexpression of stress-inducible OsBURP16, the beta subunit of polygalacturonase 1, decreases pectin content and cell adhesion and increases abiotic stress sensitivity in rice
    + Transcription of OsBURP16 is induced by cold, salinity and drought stresses, as well as by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment
    + Analysis of plant survival rates, relative ion leakage rates, accumulation levels of H2 O2 and water loss rates of leaves showed that overexpression of OsBURP16 enhanced sensitivity to cold, salinity and drought stresses compared with controls
