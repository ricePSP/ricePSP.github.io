* **Key message**  
    + Association analysis indicates that a single-nucleotide polymorphism-6 in the OsLG1 regulatory region led to a compact panicle architecture in cultivars during rice domestication
    + Transgenic plants harboring the OsLG1 promoter:GUS (beta-glucuronidase) reporter gene construct display preferential expression in developing laminar joint regions and meristemic regions
    + Here we show that the spread panicle architecture of wild rice is controlled by a dominant gene, OsLG1, a previously reported SBP-domain transcription factor that controls rice ligule development
    + These results indicate that OsLG1 is a transcriptional factor that plays an important role in building the laminar joint between leaf blade and leaf sheath boundary, thereby controlling ligule and auricle development
    + OsLG1 regulates a closed panicle trait in domesticated rice
