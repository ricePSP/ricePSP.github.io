* **Key message**  
    + CRC1 interacts with homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis1 (PAIR1) in vitro, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB formation
    + Additionally, we provide evidence that CRC1 is essential for meiotic DSB formation
    + We found that CRC1 is also essential for the recruitment of PAIR2 onto meiotic chromosomes
