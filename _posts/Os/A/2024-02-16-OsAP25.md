* **Key message**  
    + ETERNAL TAPETUM 1 directly regulates the expression of OsAP25 and OsAP37, which encode aspartic proteases that induce programmed cell death in both yeast and plants
    + Using a yeast one-hybrid method, a transcription factor, OsAP25, which interacts specifically with a GCC box was isolated from rice
    + Isolation and characterization of a novel cDNA encoding ERF/AP2-type transcription factor OsAP25 from Oryza sativa L
    + The semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsAP25 gene was constitutively expressed in leaves, roots, growing points, flower, bolting stage and grain filling stage
    + In addition, OsAP25 gene was induced by NaCl, cold, drought, abscisic acid and exogenous ethylene
    + The OsAP25 protein contained a conserved ethylene-responsive element binding factor (ERF) domain which shared identity with other reported ERF domains
