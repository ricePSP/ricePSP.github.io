* **Key message**  
    + Our results suggest that GW2 negatively regulates cell division by targeting its substrate(s) to proteasomes for regulated proteolysis
    + The BSG1 mutation affected the expression of genes potentially involved in the cell cycle and GW2, an important regulator of grain size in rice
    + Here, we report the cloning and characterization of GW2, a new QTL that controls rice grain width and weight
    + Loss of GW2 function increased cell numbers, resulting in a larger (wider) spikelet hull, and it accelerated the grain milk filling rate, resulting in enhanced grain width, weight and yield
    + The functional characterization of GW2 provides insight into the mechanism of seed development and is a potential tool for improving grain yield in crops
    + These findings provide more insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying seed size development in rice and are likely to be useful for improving rice grain yield
    + Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.
    + Rice seed size is an important agronomic trait in determining the yield potential, and four seed size related genes (GS3, GW2, qSW5/GW5 and GIF1) have been cloned in rice so far
    + It was indicated that mutual interactions exist between the two genes, in which, qSW5 affecting seed length is masked by GS3 alleles, and GS3 affecting seed width is masked by qSW5 alleles
    + However, the relationship among these four genes is still unclear, which will impede the process of gene pyramiding breeding program to some extent
    + Additionally, GIF1 expression was found to be positively regulated by qSW5 but negatively by GW2 and GS3
