* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic overexpression of OsJAC1 in rice resulted in quantitative broad-spectrum resistance against different pathogens including bacteria, oomycetes and fungi
    + Both protein domains of OsJAC1 are required to establish resistance as indicated by single or combined transient expression of individual domains
    + Altogether, our results identify OsJAC1 as a representative of a novel type of resistance proteins derived from a plant-lineage specific gene fusion event for better function in local pathogen defense
    + ) gene OsJAC1 encoding a mannose-binding jacalin-related lectin, and found that OsJAC1 was jasmonic acid (JA) inducible
    + In addition, compared with coleoptiles of wild-type plants, those of OsJAC1 overexpression rice were more sensitive to JA treatment
    + And methyl jasmonate could induce the expression of OsJAC1
