* **Key message**  
    + Both transgenic plants and yeasts harboring OsMT1a accumulated more Zn(2+) than wild type controls, suggesting OsMT1a is most likely to be involved in zinc homeostasis
    + Furthermore, the transcripts of several Zn(2+)-induced CCCH zinc finger transcription factors accumulated in OsMT1a transgenic plants, suggesting that OsMT1a not only participates directly in ROS scavenging pathway but also regulates expression of the zinc finger transcription factors via the alteration of Zn(2+) homeostasis, which leads to improved plant stress tolerance
    + OsMT1a, a type 1 metallothionein, plays the pivotal role in zinc homeostasis and drought tolerance in rice
    + The rgMT gene expression was induced in rice leaves and roots under several abiotic stresses from salts (NaCl and NaHCO3), drought (PEG) and metals (CuCl2, ZnCl2, CdCl2)
    + A metallothionein-like protein of rice (rgMT) functions in E. coli and its gene expression is induced by abiotic stresses
    + Expression analysis revealed that OsMT1a predominantly expressed in the roots, and was induced by dehydration
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsMT1a demonstrated enhanced tolerance to drought
