* **Key message**  
    + Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP-like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf-like organs
    + In case of the loss-of-function mutation of OsMADS5, no defect in either panicles or vegetative organs was observed
