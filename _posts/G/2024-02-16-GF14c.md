* **Key message**  
    + Functional analysis using either GF14c overexpression or knockout transgenic rice plants indicated that this interaction plays a role in the regulation of flowering
    + GF14c-overexpressing plants exhibited a delay in flowering and the knockout mutants displayed early flowering relative to the wild-type plants under short-day conditions
    + These results suggest that GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering by interacting with Hd3a
    + The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a
    + Overexpression of either constitutively active OsCDPK1 or GF14c enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings
