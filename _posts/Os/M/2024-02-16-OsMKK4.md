* **Key message**  
    + Further results revealed that OsMKK4 influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression of BR-related genes
    + Among MAPK kinase (MKKs) gene family, OsMKK4 transcripts were found to be induced in arsenite treated rice leaves and roots
    + Thus, our findings have identified OsMKK4 as a factor for grain size, and suggest a possible link between the MAPK pathways and BRs in grain growth
    + Involvement of the OsMKK4-OsMPK1 Cascade and its Downstream Transcription Factor OsWRKY53 in the Wounding Response in Rice
    + Taken together, components involving in the wounding signaling pathway, OsMKK4-OsMPK1-OsWRKY53, can be important players in regulating crosstalk between abiotic stress and biotic stress.

    + __OsMKK4__, __OsMPK1~OsMAPK6~OsSIPK__, [The bHLH Rac Immunity1 RAI1 Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The bHLH Rac Immunity1 RAI1 Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity%5BTitle%5D), Overexpression of OsMAPK6 and/or OsMAPK3 together with OsMKK4-dd increased PAL1 and OsWRKY19 expression in rice protoplasts
    + __OsMKK4__, __RAI1__, [The bHLH Rac Immunity1 RAI1 Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The bHLH Rac Immunity1 RAI1 Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity%5BTitle%5D), Also, RAI1 was phosphorylated by OsMAPK3/6 and OsMKK4-dd in vitro
    + __OsMKK4__, __RAI1__, [The bHLH Rac Immunity1 RAI1 Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=The bHLH Rac Immunity1 RAI1 Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity%5BTitle%5D), Therefore, the regulation of PAL1 and OsWRKY19 expression by RAI1 could be controlled via an OsMKK4-OsMAPK3/6 cascade
    + __OsMKK4__, __OsMPK1~OsMAPK6~OsSIPK__, [Involvement of the OsMKK4-OsMPK1 Cascade and its Downstream Transcription Factor OsWRKY53 in the Wounding Response in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Involvement of the OsMKK4-OsMPK1 Cascade and its Downstream Transcription Factor OsWRKY53 in the Wounding Response in Rice%5BTitle%5D), Further analysis revealed that OsMKK4, the upstream kinase of OsMPK1, phosphorylated OsMPK1 by wounding in vivo.
    + __OsMKK4__, __OsMPK1~OsMAPK6~OsSIPK__, [OsMAPK6, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, influences rice grain size and biomass production](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsMAPK6, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, influences rice grain size and biomass production%5BTitle%5D), As a functional kinase, OsMAPK6 interacts strongly with OsMKK4, indicating that OsMKK4 is likely to be the upstream MAPKK of OsMAPK6 in rice.
