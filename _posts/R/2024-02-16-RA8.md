* **Key message**  
    + The RA8 promoter may be useful for controlling gene expression in anthers of cereal plants and for generating male-sterile plants
    + An anther-specific cDNA clone of rice, RA8, was isolated from an anther cDNA library by differential screening
    + RNA blot analysis indicated that the RA8 transcript is present specifically in anthers and the transcript level increased as flowers matured, reaching the highest level in mature flowers
    + Histochemical GUS analysis showed that the RA8 promoter was active in the tapetum, endothecium, and connective tissues of anthers
    + Isolation and characterization of an anther-specific gene, RA8, from rice (Oryza sativa L.)
