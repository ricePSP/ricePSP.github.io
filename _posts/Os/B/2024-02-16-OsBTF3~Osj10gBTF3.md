* **Key message**  
    + The expression of Osj10gBTF3 was primarily constitutive and generally modulated by salt, high temperature and exogenous phytohormone stress
    + Inhibition of a basal transcription factor 3-like gene Osj10gBTF3 in rice results in significant plant miniaturization and typical pollen abortion
    + Our demonstration of the important role of Osj10gBTF3 in rice growth and development provides new insights showing that more complex regulatory functions are associated with BTF3 in plants
