    + [A Novel Tiller Angle Gene, TAC3, together with TAC1 and D2 Largely Determine the Natural Variation of Tiller Angle in Rice Cultivars.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A Novel Tiller Angle Gene, TAC3, together with TAC1 and D2 Largely Determine the Natural Variation of Tiller Angle in Rice Cultivars.%5BTitle%5D), 2016, PLoS Genet.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + TAC3 is preferentially expressed in the tiller base
    + In conclusion, there is a diverse genetic basis for tiller angle between the two subpopulations, and it is the novel gene TAC3 together with TAC1, D2, and other newly identified genes in this study that controls tiller angle in rice cultivars
