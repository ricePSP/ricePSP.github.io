* **Key message**  
    + We isolated a cDNA for ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ²-1,3-glucanase from rice anther and named it Oryza sativa glucanase 1 (Osg1)
    + RT-PCR analysis revealed that Osg1 transcripts were present in leaves, roots, and anthers
    + Osg1 was found to be expressed throughout the plant and highly expressed in florets, leaf sheaths, and leaf blades
    + The pollen mother cells appeared to be normal in Osg1-RI plants, but callose degradation was disrupted around the microspores in the anther locules of the Osg1-RI plants at the early microspore stage
    + Investigations using real-time PCR, immunocytochemical analysis, and a GUS-reporter gene driven by the Osg1 promoter indicated that Osg1 was mainly expressed at the late meiosis, early microspore, and middle microspore stages in the florets
    + The silencing of Osg1 resulted in male sterility
    + A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development
