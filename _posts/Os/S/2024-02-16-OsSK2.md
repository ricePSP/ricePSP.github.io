    + [AB188835](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AB188835)

* **Key message**  
    + Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of OsSK1 and OsSK2 was induced in rice calli by treatment with the elicitor N-acetylchitoheptaose, and that expression of OsSK1 and OsSK3 was up-regulated specifically during the heading stage of panicle development
