* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Here we report that the MEI2-LIKE PROTEIN 4 (OML4) encoded by the LARGE1 gene is phosphorylated by the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 2 (GSK2) and negatively controls grain size and weight in rice
    + We found that EHD6 can physically interact with YTH07. We showed that their interaction enhances the binding of the m6A-modified OsCOL4 mRNA and trigers relocation of a portion of YTH07 from the cytoplasm into RNP granuels through phase-separated condensates.
