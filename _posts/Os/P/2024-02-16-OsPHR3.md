    + [Integrative comparison of the role of the PHR1 subfamily in phosphate signaling and homeostasis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Integrative comparison of the role of the PHR1 subfamily in phosphate signaling and homeostasis in rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2015, Plant Physiol.

* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, unlike OsPHR2-overexpressing lines, which exhibited growth retardation under normal or Pi-deficient conditions, OsPHR3-overexpressing plants exhibited significant tolerance to low Pi stress but normal growth rates under normal Pi conditions, suggesting that OsPHR3 would be useful for molecular breeding to improve Pi uptake/use efficiency under phosphate-deficient conditions
    + We propose that OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3 form a network and play diverse roles in regulating Pi signaling and homeostasis in rice
