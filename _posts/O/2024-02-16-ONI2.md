* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + The midrib of oni2 leaf blades was not developed correctly
    + onion2 (oni2) mutants produced very small shoots in which leaves were fused to each other, and ceased growing after germination
    + These results suggest that ONI2 is a layer 1-specific gene required for development of the entire shoot and that VLCFAs play an essential role in normal shoot development in rice
