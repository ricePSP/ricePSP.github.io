* **Key message**  
    + The OsMYB2-overexpressing plants accumulated greater amounts of soluble sugars and proline than wild-type plants under salt stress
    + Overexpression of OsMYB2 enhanced up-regulation of genes encoding proline synthase and transporters
    + This study isolated a rice R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, and functionally characterized its role in tolerance to abiotic stress by generating transgenic rice plants with overexpressing and RNA interference OsMYB2
    + No difference in growth and development between the OsMYB2-overexpressing and wild-type plants was observed under normal growth conditions, but the OsMYB2-overexpressing plants were more tolerant to salt, cold, and dehydration stresses and more sensitive to abscisic acid than wild-type plants
    + These findings suggest that OsMYB2 encodes a stress-responsive MYB transcription factor that plays a regulatory role in tolerance of rice to salt, cold, and dehydration stress
    + Expression of OsMYB2 was up-regulated by salt, cold, and dehydration stress
    + A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice
