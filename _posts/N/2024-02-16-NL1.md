* **Key message**  
    + The NL1 gene encodes a GATA-type transcription factor with a single zinc finger domain, and its transcripts are detected predominantly in the bract primordia, which normally degenerate in the wild-type plants
    + To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we cloned the rice gene NECK LEAF 1 (NL1), which when mutated results in delays in flowering time, smaller panicles with overgrown bracts and abnormal UPI elongation patterns
    + Furthermore, the expression of two regulators of flowering, Hd3a and OsMADS1, was also affected in the nl1 mutant
    + Overexpression of NL1 in transgenic plants often gives rise to severe growth retardation, less vegetative phytomers and smaller leaves, suggesting that NL1 plays an important role in organ differentiation
    + On the basis of these findings, we propose that NL1 is an intrinsic factor that modulates and coordinates organogenesis through regulating the expression of PLA1 and other regulatory genes during reproductive development in rice
