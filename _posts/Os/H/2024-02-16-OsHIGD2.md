* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Transient expression of OsHIGD2 in leaf epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana provided evidence that the protein is localized to mitochondria
    + Among the genes, OsHIGD2 showed the fastest and strongest induction by hypoxia as well as submergence

* **Connection**  
    + __Adh1__, __OsHIGD2__, [A novel rice protein family of OsHIGDs may be involved in early signalling of hypoxia-promoted stem growth in deepwater rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=A novel rice protein family of OsHIGDs may be involved in early signalling of hypoxia-promoted stem growth in deepwater rice.%5BTitle%5D), Co-expression analysis indicated that OsHIGD2 had a simultaneous expression pattern with fermentation-related genes, such as ADH1 (alcohol dehydrogenase 1) and PDC2 (pyruvate decarboxylase 2)
