    + [Functional analysis of OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 revealed their involvement in the heat shock response in rice Oryza sativa L.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Functional analysis of OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 revealed their involvement in the heat shock response in rice Oryza sativa L.%5BTitle%5D), 2012, J Exp Bot.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + This report describes the role of OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 in the regulation of the HSR and seed development of rice
    + Overall, the present study reveals the role of OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 in the regulation of the HSR and seed development of rice
    + The thermotolerance assay revealed that OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 are negative regulators of HSR and involved in acquired thermotolerance but not in basal thermotolerance since their over-expression transgenic lines pre-heated at sublethal temperature, showed significantly decreased seedling survival after heat shock treatment
    + Furthermore, antioxidant activity and gene expression of catalase and peroxidase was significantly increased in knock-down transgenic seedlings of OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 after heat stress compared with the wild type
