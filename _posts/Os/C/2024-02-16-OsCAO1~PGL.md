* **Key message**  
    + This study characterizes a rice mutant, pale green leaf (pgl), and isolates the gene PGL by using a map-based cloning approach
    + Compared with wild-type plants, pgl exhibits a lower Chl content with a reduced and disorderly thylakoid ultrastructure, which decreases the photosynthesis rate and results in reduced grain yield and quality
    + Moreover, pgl is sensitive to heat stress
    + In addition, pgl exhibits premature senescence in both natural and dark-induced conditions and more severe Chl degradation and reactive oxygen species accumulation than does the wild-type

* **Connection**  
    + __OsCAO1~PGL__, __OsCAO2__, [Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice%5BTitle%5D), We have identified two genes (OsCAO1 and OsCAO2) from the rice genome that are highly homologous to previously studied chlorophyll a oxygenase (CAO) genes
    + __OsCAO1~PGL__, __OsCAO2__, [Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Differential regulation of chlorophyll a oxygenase genes in rice%5BTitle%5D), These results suggest that OsCAO1 plays a major role in chlorophyll b biosynthesis, and that OsCAO2 may function in the dark
    + __OsCAO1~PGL__, __OsPIL13~OsPIL1__, [Rice Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like1 OsPIL1 is involved in the promotion of chlorophyll biosynthesis through feed-forward regulatory loops.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like1 OsPIL1 is involved in the promotion of chlorophyll biosynthesis through feed-forward regulatory loops.%5BTitle%5D),  Using promoter binding and transactivation assays, we found that OsPIL1 binds to the promoters of two Chl biosynthetic genes, OsPORB and OsCAO1, and promotes their transcription
    + __OsCAO1~PGL__, __OsPIL13~OsPIL1__, [Rice Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like1 OsPIL1 is involved in the promotion of chlorophyll biosynthesis through feed-forward regulatory loops.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like1 OsPIL1 is involved in the promotion of chlorophyll biosynthesis through feed-forward regulatory loops.%5BTitle%5D),  Thus, OsPIL1 is involved in the promotion of Chl biosynthesis by up-regulating the transcription of OsPORB and OsCAO1 via trifurcate feed-forward regulatory loops involving two OsGLKs
