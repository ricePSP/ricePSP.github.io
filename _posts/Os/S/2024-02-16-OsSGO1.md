* **Key message**  
    + During both mitosis and meiosis, OsSGO1 is recruited from nucleoli onto centromeres at the onset of prophase
    + Moreover, the release of OsSGO1 from nucleoli is completely blocked in Ossgo1-1, which leads to the absence of OsSGO1 in centromeric regions after the onset of mitosis and meiosis
    + Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1
    + In the Tos17-insertional Ossgo1-1 mutant, centromeres of sister chromatids separate precociously from each other from metaphase I, which causes unequal chromosome segregation during meiosis II
    + OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis
